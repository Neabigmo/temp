# 2026-09-04 — R18 Laguerre–Abel endpoint audit

- Branch: `chi2-laguerre-abel-endpoint-r18-2026-09-04`.
- Scope: theory-only exact Abel transform and finite symbolic checks.
- Certified: Abel/Poisson formula, positive quadratic kernel, operator form,
  and endpoint non-coercivity witness `c=(1,-1)`.
- Limitation: only `d0`–`d3` are present in the R17 source; no all-orders
  Fock-determined `D(r)` formula was available. No Gaussian rigidity claim.
- Decision: B; the missing full `D(r)` kernel/coercivity is now explicit.

# 2026-09-05 — Theory route framework and R8 cross-parameter correction

- Added `THEORY_ROUTE_FRAMEWORK.md` as the durable theory outline for the
  Positive Backward-Tower Exact Zero-Set Rigidity program.
- The framework records the target theorem, the exact-defect/Fock, positivity,
  backward-OU, and spatial-escort layers, plus the stop conditions for routes
  that only produce finite-jet or operator-only evidence.
- R8 web review audited the transport identities and corrected the status of
  the former integrated-compensation target: `∫_0^q S = -Var_{nu_q}(K'_q)`
  under the Gaussian endpoint condition, so it is equivalent to rigidity and
  is not an intermediate lemma.
- The current concrete gap is the anisotropic same-factor posterior-variance
  coherence behind `Var(Y|X=x) <= tau`; this is recorded as the next minimal
  OPEN problem. No finite computation was needed.
- From this round onward, each C2C theory prompt must ask ChatGPT to read the
  framework and this append log through the connector before proposing work.

# 2026-09-05 — R9 posterior bridge and anisotropic ordering reduction

- Web review confirmed the posterior identities
  `W-τ=τ²K''_q`, `E_{ν_q}W=τ`, and that pointwise `W≤τ` would already force
  `K''_q=0`; it is therefore not a useful intermediate estimate.
- Audited new bridge identity: for `H_q=P_{s-q}H_s`, with `μ_{q,s}` the `Y`
  marginal of the cubic-escort three-copy bridge and
  `𝒟=E_{ν_q}Var_{π_{q,s}}(K'_s(Y))`,
  `E_{μ_{q,s}}K''_s=-𝒟≤0`, while `E_{ν_s}K''_s=0`.
- Audited escort–MMSE identity: if `λ_q=p_q dx`, `ν_q∝p_q^3dx`, and
  `ω_q=p_q^2/∫p_q^3`, then
  `E_{λ_q}W=τ-τ²E_{λ_q}(K'_q)^2`, `E_{ν_q}W=τ`, and
  `Cov_{λ_q}(W,ω_q)=τ²E_{λ_q}(K'_q)^2≥0`.
- Exact obstruction is now a missing ordering/coherence statement comparing the
  anisotropic marginal `μ_{q,s}` with the scalar escort `ν_s`; ordinary positivity,
  total positivity, finite nested horizons, and arbitrary tangents do not provide it.
- R10's proposed curvature ordering is now treated as a strict probability-level
  no-go for any non-Gaussian positive top level, not as an OPEN intermediate lemma.

# 2026-09-05 — R10 residual-Fisher reduction and shell correction

- Validated the three-copy residual dictionary
  `I_perp(q,s)=2 D_{q,s}` and
  `E_{mu_{q,s}} K''_s=-D_{q,s}=-(1/2)I_perp(q,s)`.
  For a non-Gaussian positive top level, posterior full support makes this strict
  for every `q<s`; therefore the proposed reverse curvature ordering is a strict
  probability-level no-go, not an OPEN intermediate estimate.
- Validated the nested decomposition
  `D_{q,s}=D_{q,r}+E_{mu_{q,r}} Var_{pi_{r,s}}(K'_s)` and the regular small-bridge
  asymptotic `D_{s-tau,s}/tau -> E_{nu_s}(K''_s)^2`.
- Corrected a material error in the web response: under non-Gaussian
  `lambda_s^3`, `Q/s` is not `chi^2_2`; that law belongs to the Gaussian reference.
  Consequently the claimed exponential shell density and complete monotonicity of
  `D/r` are not established and are removed from the framework.
- The pre-R11 minimal OPEN was Residual-Fisher Production Coherence: whether a
  genuine positive same-factor all-degree tower has a nested small-bridge sequence
  with `D=o(tau)`, or can rigorously sustain `D>=c tau`. R11 reclassified this after
  the fixed-factor depth audit; no finite Codex computation was needed.

# 2026-09-05 — R11 fixed-factor depth decay and compatible-tower no-go

- Independently audited the OU–heat conjugacy with a distinct OU factor `rho`:
  `P_rho=S_sqrt(rho) P_heat_(1-rho)`. For `H_a^(j)=P_heat_(1-a)g^(j)`, an exact
  backward step is `H_a^(j)(x)=H_(rho a)^(j+1)(sqrt(rho)x)`. The fixed factor
  therefore creates moving heat parameters and synchronized dilation; it does not
  create a fixed-top-level small-bridge sequence.
- For `Delta_j(a)=D^(j+1)_(rho a,a)`, the chain-rule scaling was audited as
  `Delta_j(a)=rho Delta_(j+1)(rho a)`, equivalently
  `a Delta_j(a)=(rho a) Delta_(j+1)(rho a)`.
- Positivity of `g` and the posterior Hessian give the outer-horizon cap
  `0<=D_(q,s)<=1/(1-s)` for `0<q<s<1`. Combining it with nested production and the
  scaling yields, for any genuine depth-N tower,
  `0<=D^(1)_(rho s,s)<=rho^(N-1)/(1-s)`.
- Consequence: a first pair that is projectively compatible with arbitrary depth is
  Gaussian (the bound forces `D=0`, then the R10 strict residual-Fisher no-go and
  heat injectivity close the argument). This rules out compatible non-Gaussian exact
  infinite fixed-factor towers without using the near-Gaussian assumption.
- Scope correction: the original problem still permits mutually incompatible
  depth-N towers. The bound only gives exponentially small production for that
  sequence, not exact zero at finite N. The new minimal OPEN is
  `Depth-to-Zero Production Rigidity`: obtain depth-independent zero-set isolation /
  tensor coercivity from all-degree exactness plus positivity, or identify a genuine
  probability-level tail-escape obstruction. No Codex computation was needed.

# 2026-09-05 — R12 exact-law compactness and OU-invariant-shape obstruction

- Logic-level audit: the new tail and OU statements are unconditional for the
  genuine full exact probability class `Q=sum_i(X_i-Xbar)^2 ~ chi^2_2`. They must not
  be silently inferred from a single scalar `RK=1` equation unless that equivalence
  has separately been proved. The requested nonzero `P_3K` charge sector remains a
  separate qualifier.
- From `Q >= (X1-X2)^2/2`, the exact chi-square Laplace transform, and conditional
  Jensen, obtained the uniform bound
  `E exp(eta X^2) <= exp(-eta)/(1-4 eta)` for `0<eta<1/4`. This gives uniform
  probability tightness, fixed-moment uniform integrability, and local complex MGF
  control across exact laws and tower depths; physical probability-tail escape is
  excluded.
- The same MGF estimate gives a law-independent exponential Hermite coefficient
  envelope. With OU Hermite scaling and centered variance-one cancellation of modes
  one and two, every depth-N top endpoint satisfies the uniform estimate
  `||P_(rho^N) h_N - 1||_2 = O(rho^(3N/2))` for large N.
- Audited exact OU closure geometrically: the residual-plane vector has chi-square
  radius and is sent to `sqrt(t) R + sqrt(1-t) G`; isotropic Gaussian noise preserves
  the Gaussian radial law. Thus `g in E => P_t g in E` for the full exact class.
- A single genuine nonGaussian exact law automatically generates mutually
  incompatible finite-depth towers by `g_N^(j)=P_(rho^(N-j))h`; hence Case B is
  essentially the original nonGaussian exact-law existence problem. For the required
  `P_3K != 0` sector, charge survival along this orbit must still be proved, not
  assumed.
- Absolute local isolation of Gaussian in the exact class is equivalent to global
  uniqueness because of OU closure, `L2` convergence, and OU injectivity. Therefore
  `D_N -> 0` plus ordinary continuous coercivity cannot yield finite-N exact zero.
  Physical tail escape is gone; only amplitude/spectral high-chaos escape remains.
- Reclassified the minimal OPEN as `OU-Invariant Shape Rigidity`: find an
  amplitude-normalized OU-homogeneous same-factor tensor invariant, or prove a
  genuine spectral noncompactness obstruction. No Codex computation was needed.

# 2026-09-05 — R13 primitive shape and Bochner-tail closure

- Scope audit: all reverse-OU statements below are for the genuine full exact
  class `Q=sum_i(X_i-Xbar)^2 ~ chi^2_2`, not for an unproved scalar `RK=1`
  identity. The `P_3K != 0` charge sector remains separate.
- Reverse exactness: in the residual plane,
  `R_t=sqrt(t)R+sqrt(1-t)G`. The conditional Laplace transform and the change
  `theta=t z/(1+(1-t)z)` show that if `P_t mu` is full exact, then `mu` is
  full exact. Thus actual positive OU preimages cannot leave the exact class.
- Define the probability-level maximal backward radius
  `r(mu)=sup{r>=1: mu=P_(r^-2)nu}`. The inverse characteristic-function
  candidate is `phi_nu(u)=phi_mu(r u) exp((r^2-1)|u|^2/2)`. Uniform exact-law
  sub-Gaussian bounds make preimages tight; cumulant scaling
  `kappa_m(nu)=r^m kappa_m(mu)` makes `r=+infinity` impossible for a
  nonGaussian law. A maximizing preimage exists at the probability-law level
  by weak compactness and uniform integrability, but it need not be an `L2`
  density or belong to the K-tensor regularity class.
- The radius and primitive representative are OU-invariant in the expected
  orbit coordinates:
  `r(P_tmu)=r(mu)/sqrt(t)` and `Pi(P_tmu)=Pi(mu)`. If `d>=3` is the first
  nonzero normalized Hermite moment, then
  `Theta(mu)=r(mu)|a_d(mu)|^(1/d)=|a_d(Pi(mu))|^(1/d)>0` is an OU-invariant
  primitive-shape scalar. It separates amplitude from shape but does not prove
  primitive uniqueness.
- Under the score regularity needed for the anchor expansion, the R13 local
  residual-Fisher quantity obeys
  `F_mu(a)=C_(d,rho) a^(d-1)|a_d(mu)|^2+o(a^(d-1))`, with
  `C_(d,rho)=d E Var[psi_(d-1)(Xi+sqrt(1-rho)Z)]>0` and
  `C_(3,rho)=(1-rho)(3-rho)`. Its scaling
  `F_(P_tmu)(a)=t F_mu(t a)` means it decays like `t^d` along an orbit, so it
  cannot supply the missing primitive coercivity from R11's fixed-s depth
  estimate.
- Strict obstruction: a depth-N first law factors as
  `mu_N=P_(t_N)pi_N`, `t_N<=rho^N`, `r(pi_N)=1`. R11 controls only `t_N`; any
  OU-invariant shape sees only `pi_N`. Combining the two cannot close Case B
  without primitive exact-shape uniqueness.
- Remaining escape is global inverse-OU positive-definiteness: primitive laws
  may conceivably converge weakly to Gaussian while, for fixed `r>1`, the
  inverse candidate fails Bochner positivity only at unbounded frequencies,
  Gram sizes, degenerate point configurations, or vanishing margins. This is
  distinct from the already excluded physical X-tail escape. `P_3K` survival
  is automatic only in the local d=3 leading-mode regime; general survival is
  still open.
- Reclassified the minimal OPEN as
  `Primitive Exact Shape Rigidity / Bochner-Tail Closure`: determine whether
  same-factor product plus all-degree exactness rules out that global
  inverse-OU tail escape. No Codex computation was needed; the remaining work
  is an infinite-dimensional positivity/shape argument.

# 2026-09-05 — R14 finite-complexity Bochner closure

- R14 first re-audited the R13 reverse-OU radius and primitive endpoint. Those
  probability-level statements remain valid with the same caveat: the
  primitive endpoint need not be an `L2` density or have the project's score/K
  regularity.
- New exact obstruction: writing
  `a_j(theta)=sqrt(2/3) cos(theta+2*pi*(j-1)/3)`, the full exact law obeys
  `average_theta product_j phi(a_j(theta)u)=exp(-u^2/2)`. For the inverse
  candidate `Phi_r(u)=exp((r^2-1)u^2/2) phi(r u)`, the identity remains exactly
  true because `sum_j a_j(theta)^2=1`. Its finite Gram/Hadamard tensor lifts
  remain true even when `Phi_r` is not positive definite. Hence exact
  equality, even in the all-degree tensor hierarchy, cannot by itself detect
  the primitive boundary; Bochner positivity is genuinely additional.
- Finite-complexity closure: for primitive `pi_N => gamma`, fixed `r>1`, and
  `K_N(u)=exp((r^2-1)u^2/2) phi_(pi_N)(r u)`, the R12 square-exponential bound
  gives `K_N -> exp(-u^2/2)` in every fixed local `C^k` topology. For fixed
  Gram size `m`, divide the determinant by the squared Vandermonde and use
  confluent divided differences. The Gaussian kernel has
  `D_m=e^(-sum x_i^2) det[e^(x_i x_j)]`, and Cauchy-Binet's first term gives
  `D_m/Vandermonde^2 >= e^(-m L^2)/product_{j=0}^{m-1} j!` on `|x_i|<=L`.
  Therefore, for every fixed `r,M,L`, all Gram tests with `m<=M` and bounded
  frequency are eventually PSD, even with arbitrary point collisions.
- This sharpens R13's four-way list: for primitive inverse candidates, any
  negative Bochner witness must escape through unbounded frequency diameter or
  unbounded Gram/spectral rank. Collision, small Gaussian eigenvalue margin,
  and vanishing finite-witness margin are not independent channels once the
  confluent determinant argument is used.
- Strict remaining obstruction: bounded-window `C^k` convergence does not
  control all Gram sizes because the Gaussian kernel's compact integral
  operator has eigenvalues tending to zero. The needed target is a uniform
  Gaussian-relative quadratic-form estimate, not ordinary local smooth
  convergence. The same-factor angular map is inward-contracting
  (`|a_j|<=sqrt(2/3)`), so it gives no outward frequency positivity induction.
- Conditional closure: a uniform bounded-complexity negative-witness theorem,
  or a bounded-frequency reduction plus Gaussian-relative form compactness,
  would rule out primitive exact laws converging to Gaussian. Without one of
  these, the minimal OPEN is now `Relative Bochner Closure`, with frequency
  escape and spectral-rank escape as the only remaining channels.
- `P_3K` was kept separate. The d=3 leading-mode local survival statement is
  safe; general primitive endpoint regularity and charge survival remain OPEN.
  No numerical or long Codex computation was needed; this was a proof-level
  audit and a durable framework/worklog update.

# 2026-09-05 — R15 local Bochner-to-Hankel reduction

- R15 re-read the post-R14 framework/worklog through the repaired bridge and
  attacked only `Relative Bochner Closure`. The inverse candidate for a genuine
  full-exact primitive law is
  `K_r(z)=exp((r^2-1)z^2/2) phi_pi(rz)`, with fixed `r>1`.
- Unconditional local-to-global lemma: R12's square-exponential bound gives
  `K_r` an entire order-2 growth estimate and inverse formal moments
  `m_k^(r)=i^(-k)K_r^(k)(0)` of Gaussian-type moment growth. If `K_r(x-y)` is
  PSD for every finite Gram configuration in any nonempty interval, confluent
  finite differences at zero give all inverse Hamburger matrices PSD. Hamburger
  then supplies a probability law; the order-2 growth gives a square-exponential
  moment and moment determinacy, so its characteristic function must equal
  `K_r` globally. This is a positive r-backward OU preimage, contradicting
  primitiveness. Thus every `L>0` already contains a finite negative witness;
  frequency escape is eliminated.
- Define `M_r(pi)=min{M: H_M^(r) is not PSD}`. For every primitive law this
  order is finite. If primitive full-exact laws `pi_N=>gamma`, each fixed inverse
  Hankel matrix converges to the strictly positive Gaussian one, hence
  `M_r(pi_N)->infinity`. The remaining Bochner obstruction is therefore purely
  an unbounded Hamburger/Gram rank escape.
- The proposed Gaussian-relative quadratic-form estimate on any bounded window
  is not a weaker compactness lemma: the local negative witness has
  `Q_K<0` while the Gaussian form is strictly positive, so its relative defect
  is `>1` (possibly infinite) for every primitive inverse candidate. Such an
  estimate would already be a closure theorem and cannot be assumed as an
  intermediate consequence.
- A proof audit of the Hermite stress test was recorded. With odd `n`,
  `q_n=1+A_n psi_(2n)` and `g_n=P_(r^-2)q_n`, choose
  `A_n=2/|min psi_(2n)|`. Then `q_n` is signed, `g_n` is eventually positive,
  centered and variance-one, and `g_n->1` in `L2`. Cauchy-Schwarz and
  `||psi_(2n)||_2=1` give uniform `E exp(eta X^2)` for every `eta<1/4`;
  orthogonality makes all moments below order `2n` Gaussian, while a higher
  Hankel matrix must fail because `q_n` is signed. This is not a full-exact
  counterexample; it proves only that positivity, MGF tightness and fixed-order
  Hermite convergence alone cannot bound inverse-Hankel rank.
- Minimal OPEN is now `Uniform Inverse-Hankel Rank Closure`: does the genuine
  same-factor all-degree exact hierarchy plus forward positivity force an
  N-independent finite inverse-Hankel failure order? `P_3K` remains separate;
  no uniform charge-to-Hankel implication was obtained. No long computation or
  numerical scan was needed.

# 2026-09-05 — R16 primitive closedness / tail-to-head viability

- R16 re-read the post-R15 local record through the repaired connection. It did
  not prove a uniform inverse-Hankel bound. Its substantive result is a sharper
  reformulation: `M_r(pi)` is the exit time of an inverse exact Jacobi control
  trajectory from the Hankel viability strip.
- Using the already established full-exact Jacobi factorization, with formal
  inverse moments `m_k^(r)`, Jacobi coefficients `alpha_j,beta_j`, and
  `S_j=sum_{ell<=j} alpha_ell`, the exact `Q^n` identity has the form
  `G_n=(2^n/3^(n-1))*product_{j<n} beta_j*(beta_n+S_(n-1)^2-B_n)`.
  Before the first Hankel exit this gives `beta_n=B_n-S_(n-1)^2`; with
  `u_n=S_(n-1)/sqrt(B_n)`, positivity is exactly `|u_n|<=1`.
- The `Q^n` equation is triangular in the moments: the coefficient of the new
  even moment is `3(2/3)^n`, while `m_(2n-1)` cannot occur because a term with
  that exponent leaves total exponent one in the other variables and is killed
  by centering (`m_1=0`). Thus higher exact equations do not algebraically feed
  back to previously selected odd controls. Any uniform rank bound, if true,
  must come from nonlocal infinite-tail positivity/growth.
- Finite-horizon no-go: for any finite `M`, perturb a Gaussian moment prefix by a
  small nonzero `m_(2M-1)` while keeping `m_(2M)` Gaussian. Strict positivity of
  the Gaussian truncated Hankel block and the one-dimensional truncated
  Hamburger theorem give a real positive centered variance-one non-Gaussian law
  passing the first `M` exact `Q` checks. A forward OU step preserves positivity
  and the same finite `Q`-moment checks. This is not a full-exact counterexample;
  it rules out only finite-prefix proofs of a uniform `M(r)`.
- Let `E` be the genuine full-exact probability class and
  `A_M(r)={mu in E: H_M^(r)(mu)>=0}`. Combining fixed-moment continuity from R12
  with the R15 local-Hamburger lemma gives
  `intersection_M A_M(r)={mu in E: backward_radius(mu)>=r}`.
  Consequently fixed-r Uniform Inverse-Hankel Rank Closure is equivalent to
  primitive laws not accumulating on the deeper backward-divisible stratum;
  over all `r>1`, it is equivalent to weak closedness of the primitive stratum
  inside `E`. Ordinary probability/MGF compactness supplies only upper
  semicontinuity of backward radius and permits an upward jump in the limit.
- `P_3K` remains logically separate. No audited implication from nonzero third
  charge to `m_3!=0`, or to a uniformly bounded inverse-Hankel failure order,
  was found. Even d=3 local survival can have arbitrarily small amplitude while
  every fixed Gaussian Hankel block remains strictly interior.
- Minimal OPEN is now `Primitive Closedness / Tail-to-Head Viability`: determine
  whether full-exact probability positivity and uniform exact-law growth force
  backward divisibility depth to be stable under weak limits. A rank-escape
  sequence would have every fixed prefix asymptotically Gaussian but
  `M_r(pi_N)->infinity`; no genuine full-exact example is known. No long
  numerical computation was needed.

# 2026-09-05 — R17 OU–Laguerre spectral-tail viability

- R17 re-read the post-R16 framework/worklog through the repaired connection.
  The genuine full-exact class `E` is weakly compact and weakly closed under the
  R12 uniform square-exponential bound: tensor-product weak convergence and the
  continuous map `Q` preserve the exact `chi^2_2` law, while uniform
  integrability preserves centering and variance.
- For fixed `r>1`, the backward-divisible stratum satisfies
  `E_r={mu in E: radius(mu)>=r}=P_(r^-2)(E)`, by forward-OU continuity and
  reverse exactness. Hence `E_r` is compact/closed and the backward radius is
  upper semicontinuous. Primitive closedness needs the missing opposite
  stability; ordinary probability/MGF compactness does not supply it.
- New exact OU–Laguerre coordinates: with
  `U=(X1+X2+X3)/sqrt(3)=sqrt(3)*barX` and `T=Q/2~Exp(1)`, define
  `C_(ell,n)(mu)=E[psi_ell(U)L_n(T)]`. Common/residual orthogonal coordinates
  show the exact diagonal law
  `C_(ell,n)(P_s mu)=s^(n+ell/2) C_(ell,n)(mu)`.
  The local `conditional_laguerre_odd_r17` replay already verifies the ordinary
  Laguerre convention, orthogonality, odd highest-moment triangularity, and the
  finite conditional-moment formulas; the scaling itself follows from chaos
  degree `ell+2n`.
- For a positive full-exact law, conditional Bessel/Parseval gives
  `sum_n C_(ell,n)^2 <= E psi_ell(U)^2 <= A_ell`, with `A_ell` uniformly
  controlled for fixed `ell` by R12 growth. Therefore any positive
  `r`-backward preimage forces the all-order sector inequality
  `sum_n r^(4n+2ell) C_(ell,n)(mu)^2 <= A_ell`.
  In the `ell=1` sector, `C_(1,n)=sqrt(3)c_n` for
  `c_n=E[barX L_n(T)]` and `E U^2=1`, giving
  `3*sum_n r^(4n+2)c_n^2 <= 1` and the individual radius bound
  `radius(mu) <= (3*c_n^2)^(-1/(4n+2))` when `c_n!=0`.
- This is a genuine full-exact all-order viability constraint, but only
  sector-wise. It does not yet give cross-sector weighted-tail tightness, so it
  does not prove primitive closedness. The missing exchange is between weak
  coefficientwise convergence and sums weighted by `r^(4n+2ell)`; mass may move
  to `n->infinity` unless simultaneous all-degree control is proved.
- Stronger ordinary-class no-go: for odd `n`, let
  `psi_(2n)=H_(2n)/sqrt((2n)!)`, `b_n=min psi_(2n)<0`, and
  `g_n=1+(-1/b_n)psi_(2n)` relative to Gaussian. Each is a nonnegative
  centered variance-one density touching zero. Its inverse OU candidate becomes
  negative at the minimum for every nontrivial inverse step, so it is primitive;
  `a_n=O(n^(1/4))` gives weak convergence to Gaussian and the generating
  function gives uniform square-exponential moments for every `eta<1/4`.
  Orthogonality makes its first `n-1` `Q`-moments exactly chi-square. This is
  not a full-exact counterexample (the nth `Q` moment changes), but proves that
  ordinary positivity, growth, and arbitrarily long finite exact prefixes cannot
  replace simultaneous all-degree exactness. It also has `||g_n-1||_2=a_n`,
  so it is a weak/MGF, not an L2-near-Gaussian, stress test.
- Minimal OPEN is now `All-Degree Spectral-Tail Tightness`: can genuine
  full-exact product structure plus positivity prevent OU-eigenmode,
  Laguerre, and Jacobi control mass from escaping to infinite chaos degree?
  A sufficient target is uniform inverse-weighted tail tightness across the
  complete conditional/angular sectors. `P_3K` remains separate: no audited
  charge-to-Laguerre lower bound or uniform inverse-Hankel implication was
  obtained. No long numerical computation was needed.

# 2026-09-05 — R18 same-factor matrix Hardy gain / relative tail-to-head coercivity

- R18 re-read the durable framework and worklog through the repaired connection
  before starting. It attacked only the R17 target `All-Degree Spectral-Tail
  Tightness`, and did not claim primitive closedness or Gaussian rigidity.
- The complete conditional generating function is a single cross-sector object.
  With `U=(X1+X2+X3)/sqrt(3)`, `T=Q/2~Exp(1)`, `C_(ell,n)=E[psi_ell(U)L_n(T)]`,
  `0<=q<1`, and `d=1-q`, the tilted triple law
  `dP_q=d^(-1) exp(-qT/d)d(mu^3)` gives
  `M_mu(q,z)=E_Pq exp(zU-z^2/2)
  =sum_(ell,n) C_(ell,n) q^n z^ell/sqrt(ell!)`.
  Its kernel `K_q(z,w)=exp(z*conj(w))*M_mu(q,z+conj(w))` is PSD because it is
  a Gram kernel. A Hubbard–Stratonovich step gives the same-factor cubic
  representation through `A_q(y)=E_mu exp(yX-qX^2/(2d))`:
  `M_mu(q,z)=d^(-1)exp(-z^2/2)E_G A_q((z+sqrt(q/d)G)/sqrt(3))^3`.
- A new unconditional spectral lemma follows from Mehler. If
  `a_m(mu)=E_mu psi_m(X)`, then for `rho<1`, the R12 square-exponential bound
  gives a uniform `sum_m rho^m a_m(mu)^2` bound. Unitary common/residual
  rotation preserves total-degree energy, so the full conditional/angular
  coefficients `B_(D,alpha)` satisfy
  `sup_(mu in E) sum_(D,alpha) rho^D |B_(D,alpha)|^2 <= K(rho)^3`.
- More importantly, in `E_r`, `r>1`, write `mu=P_(r^-2)nu`, `nu in E`. OU degree
  scaling and the preceding subcritical estimate imply, for `1<lambda<r^2`,
  `sup_(mu in E_r) sum_(D,alpha) lambda^D |B_(D,alpha)|^2
  <= K(lambda/r^2)^3`; for `1<lambda_0<lambda<r^2`, the tail is bounded by
  `K(lambda/r^2)^3(lambda_0/lambda)^M`. Thus complete cross-sector
  supercritical moving-scale tightness is already true inside the deeper
  backward-divisible stratum.
- A conditional closure target is now explicit. If `pi in E_R`, `1<r<R`, write
  `pi=P_(R^-2)xi` and `nu_r=P_(r^2/R^2)xi`. Chebyshev plus the OU kernel gives a
  Gaussian minorant `nu_r >= c gamma_tau` for every `0<tau<1-r^2/R^2`, hence
  `L_(nu_r)(p^2)>=c E_(gamma_tau)p^2`. Therefore a relative quadratic-form
  estimate
  `sup_p |(L_(N,r)-L_(nu_r))(p^2)|/E_(gamma_tau)p^2 -> 0`
  would force positivity of the limiting inverse formal form and, by the R15
  Hamburger/moment-determinacy bridge, rule out primitive convergence into
  `E_R`. This is the missing relative matrix/Loewner Hardy gain.
- Strict no-go: conditional/angular PSD, exact radial `T~Exp(1)`, and uniform
  growth alone do not control the Abel boundary. An explicit exchangeable but
  non-iid construction with `U_omega=sigma_omega Z+epsilon(cos(omega T)-
  (1+omega^2)^(-1))` has Laguerre transform
  `1/(1+omega^2(1-q)^2)-1/(1+omega^2)`; its complex poles approach `q=1` and
  its spectral mass escapes to high Laguerre degree. It is deliberately not a
  `mu^3` law, so it is not a genuine full-exact counterexample; it only shows
  that same-factor iid factorization must be used essentially.
- `P_3K` remains separate. No audited charge-to-Laguerre/Loewner lower bound or
  charge-to-Hankel rank estimate was found. A nonzero qualitative charge may
  still sit at radial index `n->infinity`.
- Local proof-level checks: `F:/anaconda3/python.exe
  conditional_laguerre_odd_r17/audit_r17.py` passed with
  `R17_AUDIT_COMPLETED`; `F:/anaconda3/python.exe
  laguerre_abel_endpoint_r18/audit_r18.py` passed with
  `R18_AUDIT_COMPLETED` and retained its earlier decision that the Abel
  endpoint is non-coercive. No optimizer, Gram scan, long numerical campaign,
  or remote computation was needed.
- Minimal OPEN is now `Same-Factor Matrix Hardy Gain / Relative Tail-to-Head
  Coercivity`: can genuine iid same-factor all-degree exactness make the
  supercritical tail bound open/stable around `E_R`? The exchangeable model is
  not promoted to a project counterexample, and Gaussian rigidity remains
  OPEN.

# 2026-09-05 — R19 posterior witness alignment / reverse-Schur coercivity

- R19 re-read the durable framework and worklog through the R18 commit
  `8d38b82` before working. It remained restricted to the genuine full-exact
  iid class and did not claim Gaussian rigidity.
- The new coordinate is the maximal Gaussian component
  `g(mu)=sup{a: mu=rho*gamma_a}`, which is equivalent to the backward radius by
  `g(mu)=1-r(mu)^(-2)`. Under the quadratic/Esscher posterior
  `dmu_(t,y) proportional to exp(yx-tx^2/2)dmu`, complete-the-square algebra
  gives the exact conjugacy `g(mu_(t,y))=g(mu)/(1+t*g(mu))`. Thus posteriorization
  preserves, rather than removes, the primitive boundary.
- For `r>1`, `d_r=1-r^(-2)`, define
  `sigma_(r,t)^2=d_r/(1+d_r*t)` and
  `B_(r;t,y)(z)=exp(-sigma_(r,t)^2*z^2/2)A_t(y+z)/A_t(y)`. In the established
  growth/determinacy range, `mu in E_r` is equivalent to this fixed-slice
  posterior deconvolution being a probability MGF, or equivalently to the
  complete posterior Wick–Hankel quadratic form
  `W_(r,t,y)[p]=E_(mu_(t,y))[(exp(-sigma_(r,t)^2*partial_x^2/2)p^2)(X)]`
  being nonnegative for every polynomial `p`.
- If `pi in E_R` and `1<r<R`, the limit has a strict posterior Gaussian margin
  `Delta_(R,r,t)=(d_R-d_r)/((1+d_R*t)(1+d_r*t))>0`. Therefore a relative
  Wick–Hankel convergence estimate on one fixed posterior slice would force
  positivity for all polynomial squares and, via Hamburger determinacy, rule out
  primitive convergence into `E_R`.
- The same-factor iid cube can be rewritten with the escort
  `deta_t(y)=(1+t)A_t(y)^3 dgamma_(t/3)(y)` and residual coefficients satisfying
  `sum alpha_j=0`, `sum alpha_j^2=1` as an escort-averaged cubic identity for
  the candidates `B_(r;t,y)`. Its second-order content is only a positive
  average variance deficit, not a pointwise Loewner floor.
- R19's strict iid-compatible obstruction is a quantifier mismatch: primitive
  slices yield `for every y there exists a high-rank negative witness`, while
  the cubic average would need `there exists one coherent witness` effective
  on a nontrivial set of `y`. No reverse-Schur/common-witness theorem is known
  here. Log-convexity only reaches rank 2; posteriorization is an exact
  conjugacy; translation covariance only relabels the escort parameter.
- `P_3K` remains logically separate. No charge-to-Laguerre, charge-to-Loewner,
  or fixed-rank negative lower bound was obtained, and no genuine full-exact
  iid non-closed sequence was constructed.
- Added `posterior_witness_alignment_r20/audit_r20.py`. It passed six small
  symbolic checks and printed `R20_AUDIT_COMPLETED`: Gaussian-component
  conjugacy, posterior deconvolution moments, strict gap, Gaussian escort
  identity, Gaussian escort normalization, and translation covariance. The
  Gaussian identity check is explicitly only a consistency check, not a
  rigidity proof.
- Minimal OPEN is now `Same-Factor Uniform Witness Alignment / Reverse-Schur
  Coercivity`. Gaussian rigidity remains OPEN.

# 2026-09-06 — R20 affine-Hankel diagonal capture / multiscale reverse-Schur

- R20 re-read the durable framework and worklog through commit `7ec40ac` before
  working. It stayed within the genuine full-exact iid class: no finite-prefix,
  formal-kernel, exchangeable, or Gaussian-only object was treated as a counterexample.
- The posterior deconvolution slices have an exact Esscher-affine relation. With
  `C(z)=B_(r;t,0)(z)`,
  `B_(r;t,y)(z)=exp(sigma^2*y*z) C(y+z)/C(y)`. Their Hankel Gram matrices are
  positive scalar plus invertible positive diagonal congruences of the same base
  Hankel kernel at translated nodes. Hence minimum negative-Gram size is invariant
  in `y`, and a base witness can be explicitly transported to every posterior slice.
  The former slice-wise witness-alignment obstruction is therefore solved.
- The same-factor cubic is exactly a diagonal tensor compression:
  `A1 o A2 o A3 = J^*(A1 tensor A2 tensor A3)J`, where
  `Je_i=e_i tensor e_i tensor e_i`. The remaining geometry is multiscale affine
  alignment across `y/2+alpha_j*s` and dimension-free diagonal-tensor capture.
- A strict finite-dimensional generic reverse-Schur no-go was audited with the
  tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix `A_m=I+(3/5)(S+S^*)`, `m>=5`: `A_m` is indefinite,
  while `A_m^(o3)` is positive definite with lower eigenvalue above `71/125`.
  Its spread-out negative sine mode has diagonal-capture mass at most `8/m^2`.
  This is not a probability or full-exact iid counterexample; it only rules out a
  generic Loewner-to-Hadamard converse.
- Conditional closure now requires a Hankel-specific negative-direction alignment,
  a uniform diagonal-capture lower bound, and dimension-independent domination of
  the positive remainder. Overlap alone does not force a negative compressed
  Rayleigh quotient.
- `P_3K` remains disconnected: no charge-to-capture, charge-to-Laguerre, or
  charge-to-Loewner quantitative bridge was obtained, and no genuine full-exact
  iid non-closed sequence was constructed.
- Extended `posterior_witness_alignment_r20/audit_r20.py` with symbolic/numeric
  checks for the Esscher-affine congruence, diagonal compression, Toeplitz
  reverse-Schur no-go, and `O(m^(-2))` capture bound. The run passed and printed
  `R20_AUDIT_COMPLETED`; it is an algebraic consistency audit, not a rigidity proof.
- Minimal OPEN is now `Affine-Hankel Diagonal-Capture / Multiscale Reverse-Schur`.
  Gaussian rigidity remains OPEN.

# 2026-09-06 — R21 post-failure tensor-tail domination

- R21 re-read the durable framework and worklog through commit `8075da1` before
  working. It remained within the genuine full-exact iid inverse formal hierarchy;
  no finite matrix, non-iid object, or formal candidate was treated as a full-exact
  probability counterexample.
- A two-dimensional residual rotational lift was isolated. For
  `A A^T=I_2`, `A^T A=I_3-11^T/3`, the SO(2)-average of any residual polynomial
  square depends only on `Q=|AX|^2`; existing all-degree exactness therefore
  identifies its formal value with the corresponding `gamma_2` value. This is an
  algebraic lift inside the existing formal hierarchy, not a positivity claim.
- If the first nonflat inverse-Hankel failure is at `M`, with
  `h_0,...,h_(M-1)>0` and `h_M<0`, degree-`M` residual polynomial tests have the
  exact decomposition `h_M sum_j |H_M(O v_j)|^2 + R_F(O)`, with `R_F>=0`.
  Rotational averaging gives the first-pivot capture factor
  `3(2/3)^M ||H_M||_(L2(S1))^2`; pointwise residual coefficients obey the same
  exponential scale. Thus a dimension-free reverse-Schur theorem using only the
  first failing block is impossible even in the genuine iid residual geometry.
- For the ridge, this multiplier is
  `lambda_(2M)=3(2/3)^M binom(2M,M)/4^M`, asymptotic to
  `3(2/3)^M/sqrt(pi*M)`, matching the previously audited even-mode Fock loss.
- The whole cubic hierarchy is not thereby ruled out. At degree `3M`, the
  `(M,M,M)` tensor partition has a triple-negative `h_M^3` contribution with exact
  angular coefficient
  `Gamma_M=((3M)!/(M!^3))^2 binom(2M,M)/(54^M*4^M)`, whose Stirling scale is
  `3(27/2)^M/(4*pi^(5/2)*M^(5/2))`. Unknown signs and sizes of
  `h_(M+1),...,h_(3M)` and other partitions may still cancel it.
- The new conditional closure target is therefore post-failure Jacobi/tensor-tail
  domination: a bound such as
  `R_M <= (1-epsilon) Gamma_M |h_M|^3` for a suitable degree-`3M` test would
  expose the negative pivot and close primitive rank escape. No such bound is
  currently proved.
- The residual `cos(3*theta)` harmonic is not the nonlinear log-density charge
  `P_3K`; no quantitative `P_3K` bridge was found. Gaussian rigidity remains OPEN,
  and no genuine full-exact iid non-closed sequence was constructed.
- Added `post_failure_tensor_tail_r21/audit_r21.py` and its README. The audit passed
  residual projection geometry, a representative rotational lift, first-failure
  capture/ridge multiplier, and the exact `Gamma_M` formula with a small
  log-Stirling check, printing `R21_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.
- Minimal OPEN is now `Post-Failure Tensor-Tail Domination`. Gaussian rigidity
  remains OPEN.

# 2026-09-06 — R22 adjacent heat-Hankel transversality / flat leakage

- R22 re-read the durable framework and worklog through commit `13f36d2` before
  working. It stayed within the genuine full-exact iid inverse formal hierarchy;
  no finite matrix, non-iid law, or formal candidate was promoted to a
  full-exact counterexample.
- Forward positivity can be written after scaling `tilde(mu)=D_r mu` as a
  backward Gaussian heat transform with `b=r^2-1`. Vandermonde harmonicity and
  the heat product identity give
  `D_n(Lambda_r)=sum_k (-b)^k C_(n,k)`, with every `C_(n,k)>=0` and universal top
  coefficient `C_(n,N_n)=prod_(j=0)^n j!`. This is a genuine all-order positivity
  constraint, but it is an alternating polynomial at negative heat time.
- The expansion does not compare the different coefficient arrays for
  `D_M,D_(M+1),...,D_(3M)`. Thus it gives no zero interlacing, small-value
  transversality, determinant-ratio bound, or uniform flat-leakage horizon. In
  particular, absolute moment growth does not prevent `D_M` from approaching zero.
- At a corank-one flat crossing, the first Jacobi norm crosses transversely:
  `h'_M=L[(P'_M)^2]>=M^2 h_(M-1)>0`. The next determinant has the exact leakage
  formula `D_(M+1)=-D_(M-1)*ell_M^2`. If `ell_M` is nonzero, the first nearby
  post-failure norm is generically positive, so the nearest mixed tensor sector
  helps rather than cancels the negative `h_M^3` channel. If `ell_M=0`, coherent
  leakage can be delayed; infinite delay would force a finite-atomic flat branch,
  incompatible with the continuous chi-square radial law, but no uniform delay
  bound is known.
- For a fixed countable sequence, real-analytic determinant dependence permits a
  generic radius avoiding all individual determinant zeros, giving quasi-definite
  Jacobi coordinates. This is only fixed-sequence coordinate hygiene and does
  not yield uniform near-flat coercivity.
- Any degree-`3M` residual test with nonzero top part has a nonzero rotationally
  averaged `h_(3M)` channel. Translation invariance also forces six adjacent
  coefficients around a nonzero `(M,M,M)` coefficient, with the sharp lower bound
  `sum_six |c_adj|^2 >= 3M^2/(2(M+1)^2)|c_(M,M,M)|^2`. If `h_M,h_(M+1)<0`, these
  adjacent sectors are positive and can already compete with the central cubic
  term under the stated Jacobi-ratio threshold.
- Exact triangularity leaves the new odd moment `m_(2M+1)` free at the relevant
  stage, and the near-flat denominator in `alpha_M` can blow up. Therefore no
  relative `beta_(M+1)/|beta_M|` bound follows from exactness plus absolute
  growth alone. The most precise missing bridge is cross-rank heat-Hankel
  zero/small-value geometry or a flat-leakage horizon theorem.
- `P_3K` remains disconnected. The residual `cos(3*theta)` harmonic is not the
  nonlinear log-density charge, and no charge-to-leakage, charge-to-Jacobi, or
  charge-to-determinant estimate was obtained. Gaussian rigidity remains OPEN,
  and no genuine full-exact iid non-closed sequence was constructed.
- Added `post_failure_tensor_tail_r22/audit_r22.py` and its README. The audit
  passed the Vandermonde heat identity/top coefficient, flat transversality,
  flat leakage determinant, adjacent coefficient bound, and representative
  degree-`3M` `h_(3M)` channel check, printing `R22_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.
- Minimal OPEN is now `Adjacent Heat-Hankel Transversality / Flat-Leakage
  Control`. Gaussian rigidity remains OPEN.

# 2026-09-06 — R23 near-flat Laurent law / cross-rank heat-Hankel geometry

- R23 re-read the durable framework and worklog through commit `90ca19e` and
  stayed inside the genuine full-exact iid inverse heat-Hankel hierarchy.  A
  positive finite-prefix matrix, an exchangeable/non-iid construction, or a
  formal inverse candidate is not a full-exact probability counterexample.
- At a corank-one flat crossing with `ell_M != 0`, write
  `h_M=c*s+O(s^2)`.  The R22 leakage identity gives
  `h_(M+1)=-ell_M^2/(c*s)+O(1)` and
  `beta_(M+1)=-ell_M^2/(c^2*s^2)+O(1/s)`.  Hence the first adjacent norm is
  positive on the `h_M<0` side, while the Jacobi coordinate is singular near
  flatness.  This can help a cubic negative channel, but it is not a uniform
  upper bound on `beta_(M+1)/|beta_M|`.
- For truncated heat admissible radii
  `g_n=sup{a: H_n(exp(-a*partial_x^2/2)mu) PSD}`, leading-principal-block
  inclusion proves `g_(n+1)<=g_n`.  This is only one-sided nested radius data;
  identifying `inf_n g_n` with a full backward radius requires the full
  moment-cone/determinacy passage.  No real zero interlacing or cross-rank
  small-value transversality follows, and higher-rank complex roots are not
  excluded by forward positivity alone.
- The `ell_M=0` branch can have coherent leakage delayed to higher rank.  Infinite
  delay would produce a finite-atomic flat branch incompatible with the
  continuous `chi_2^2` endpoint law, but no uniform finite leakage horizon is
  available from triangularity.  Absolute moment growth likewise does not
  control the determinant ratio; degree `3M` still necessarily exposes an
  `h_(3M)` channel.
- Conditional closure still needs a genuine iid-compatible cross-rank theorem:
  either a determinant-ratio/small-value estimate away from near-flatness or a
  uniform leakage horizon in the coherent flat branch, iterated through
  `M+2,...,3M`.  `P_3K` remains separate; no charge-to-Jacobi/determinant/Loewner
  bridge was found.  Gaussian rigidity remains OPEN and no genuine iid
  non-closed sequence was constructed.
- Added `adjacent_heat_hankel_r23/audit_r23.py` and README.  The audit passed
  near-flat Laurent asymptotics, truncated PSD-radius principal-block
  monotonicity, heat-interval/derivative-bound algebra, Schur trichotomy,
  atomic-shadow sign convention, plateau support-count arithmetic, the
  Bernoulli determinant/discriminant no-go, the adjacent determinant ratio
  identity, and the adjacent-sector threshold, printing
  `R23_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  These are local algebraic checks only.
- The correct R23 minimum OPEN is now `Flat-Shadow One-Step Overshoot
  Exclusion`: under `ell_M=0`, prove or refute `q_M>=0`, equivalently rule out
  the next-Q-moment overshoot of the M-atomic iid quadrature shadow.  If that
  bridge holds, the remaining scale problem is improving the unconditional
  `O(M^3)` plateau horizon to `O(M)` (ideally `<=3M`).

# 2026-09-06 — R24 infinite-tail flat-shadow orientation

- R24 re-read the durable framework and worklog through the R23 final revision
  `a006184` before starting.  The web-side analysis remained inside the genuine
  full-exact iid class; all finite-prefix constructions below are strategy
  no-go evidence, not full-exact counterexamples.
- At a corank-one inverse-heat boundary with
  `H_(M-1) ≻ 0`, `H_M ⪰ 0`, `ker H_M = <P_M>` and `ell_M = 0`, the null relation
  extends one degree.  The next monic Schur direction is `x P_M`, so the
  dangerous Schur complement is exactly
  `q_M = L_(a_*)(x^2 P_M^2)`.  With `v_*=1-a_*` and
  `T=Q/(2v_*)`, this is equivalently
  `q_M = 3^M v_*^(M+1)[(M+1)! - E_(nu_M^3)T^(M+1)]`
  and
  `q_M = (-1)^M 3^M v_*^(M+1)(M+1)! E L_(M+1)(T)`.
  Thus the one-step question is an orientation statement for the first unfixed
  radial Laguerre coefficient, not a generic finite quadrature inequality.
- A fully explicit positive 3-atomic Jacobi seed has one-body moments
  `(1,0,1,1,3,4-2√3,22,3-36√3,274+44√3)`.  Its three iid copies satisfy
  `EQ=2`, `EQ^2=8`, `EQ^3=48`, but
  `EQ^4=4336/9+64√3>384`.  Its annihilating `P_3` gives `ell_3=0`; choosing
  the formal next even moment to make `Q^4` exact yields
  `q_3=-(165+108√3)<0`.
- The same bad branch survives any preassigned finite exact horizon by the
  triangular odd-moment freedom, and sufficiently large forward Gaussian
  smoothing restores strict finite Hankel positivity.  This proves a strong
  finite-horizon iid-compatible no-go: no proof using only a fixed finite number
  of exact `Q` equations can establish `q_M>=0`.  It does not construct a
  genuine full-exact non-Gaussian law; the missing implication is genuinely
  infinite-tail -> one-step sign.
- A local plateau refinement is available: `q_M>0` implies
  `g_M=g_(M+1)>g_(M+2)`, because PSD at rank `M+2` would force the null
  polynomial to be orthogonal through degree `M+2`, contradicting
  `L(x^2P_M^2)=q_M>0`.  Hence a long plateau can only occur in the more
  degenerate `q_M=0` branch.  The remaining scale problem can be written as an
  M-atomic residual Laguerre zero-multiplicity bound, ideally with first defect
  `<3M`.
- Added `infinite_tail_flat_shadow_r24/audit_r24.py` and README.  The local audit
  passed the null-square/explicit-overshoot calculation, the Laguerre sign
  identity, and the positive Gaussian-smoothed finite-prefix witness, printing
  `R24_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  It intentionally does not prove the infinite-tail
  orientation, the `<3M` plateau bound, or any `P_3K` bridge.
- The correct R24 minimum OPEN is now `Infinite-Tail Flat-Shadow Orientation`:
  under the genuine full-exact boundary and `ell_M=0`, prove or refute
  `L(x^2P_M^2)>=0`, equivalently the first unfixed Laguerre sign.  Gaussian
  rigidity remains OPEN.

# 2026-09-06 — R25 flat null-square tail-to-head positivity

- R25 reread the durable framework and worklog through commit `02f4bca` before
  working.  It stayed inside the genuine full-exact iid class; no finite-prefix
  construction, ordinary iid stress test, formal extension, or non-iid law was
  promoted to a full-exact counterexample.
- At an `ell_M=0` common boundary,
  `D_M(a_*)=D_(M+1)(a_*)=0` and the quasi-definite factorization
  `D_(M+1)=D_M h_(M+1)` give the exact derivative identity
  `D_(M+1)'(a_*)=q_M D_M'(a_*)`.  Since `D_M'(a_*)<0`, the orientation is
  equivalently `q_M>=0 <=> D_(M+1)'(a_*)<=0`.  This is an adjacent common-root
  orientation, not a claim of complete real-rootedness or classical interlacing.
- The null relations also give the same-factor residual identity
  `q_M=(3/4)L^3(Psi_M)`, where
  `Psi_M=sum_i (X_i-bar X)^2 P_M(X_i)^2` is pointwise nonnegative.  The inverse
  triple functional is not known to be positive on this special square, so this
  is a precise reduction, not the missing sign theorem.
- If `q_M<0` and `Delta_M=g_M-g_(M+1)`, integrating the two heat-Hankel
  derivative inequalities yields
  `-q_M >= M^2(M+1)^2 h_(M-1)(a_*) Delta_M^2/2`.  Thus a nondegenerate local
  family cannot keep a fixed negative overshoot while collapsing the adjacent
  radius gap.
- Define `Omega_K=sup(-q_M)_+` over a fixed local window of `K`-prefix laws with
  a common square-exponential bound and a positive lower-block margin.  The
  prefix classes are nested, so `Omega_(K+1)<=Omega_K`.  Under those explicit
  uniformity assumptions, tightness plus uniform integrability makes
  `Omega_K->0` equivalent to exclusion of a genuine full-exact bad boundary in
  the window.  This is a conditional compactness formulation; the decay modulus
  itself remains OPEN.  R24's arbitrary finite-horizon overshoot is compatible
  because some uniform quantity must degenerate along such a sequence.
- Added `flat_null_square_r25/audit_r25.py` and README.  The local proof-level
  audit passed the common-root derivative identity, residual null-square identity,
  radius-gap integration, and the nested-prefix Omega proxy, printing
  `R25_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  R24's audit was rerun and still printed
  `R24_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.
- The current minimum OPEN is now `Flat Null-Square Tail-to-Head Positivity`:
  prove or refute the special residual-weighted square positivity (or establish
  the equivalent derivative orientation / `Omega_K` decay) for genuine full-exact
  iid laws.  The `P_3K` sector remains logically disconnected, and Gaussian
  rigidity remains OPEN.  R26 should attack the R18 conditional-matrix or
  Hubbard--Stratonovich route before returning to the `<3M` plateau target.

# 2026-09-06 — R26 residual-corrected flat null-square Hardy gain

- R26 reread the durable framework, worklog, R25 README/audit, and the recorded
  R25 state `fb8c7e4` before working.  The web-side analysis remained inside the
  genuine full-exact iid law class.  No ordinary iid stress test, finite-prefix
  construction, formal inverse candidate, exchangeable/non-iid law, or raw
  conditional PSD statement was promoted to a full-exact counterexample.
- The reverse-heat product identity was reduced to a directly auditable formula:
  `P_a((P_(-a)F)^2)=sum_alpha a^|alpha|/alpha! (partial^alpha F)^2`.  For
  `F_i=(X_i-bar X)P_M(X_i)`, the R25 residual identity then gives
  `A_M=4q_M/3+E_M`, where `A_M` is the forward-probability square energy and
  `E_M` is the lower-rank Gaussian-noise correction.  Every nonzero derivative
  has one-body degree at most `M`, so `E_M>=0` is conditional on `H_M(L)>=0`.
  The missing inequality is `A_M>=E_M`; this is not supplied by forward
  positivity or inverse positivity on arbitrary squares.
- Completing the square gives the exact posterior pullback with
  `D=1+at`, `s=y/D`, and `u=t/D`:
  `A_t^mu(y)=D^(-1/2) exp(ay^2/(2D)) L(exp(sX-uX^2/2))`.
  On the flat null direction the numerator has jet
  `q_M(s^2-u)/2+O(|s|^3+|s|u+u^2)`.  Since the natural three-copy escort has
  `E[Y^2]=t/3+O(t^2)`, common-only HS averaging has the strict leading orientation
  `-q_M t/3+o(t)`, so it cannot prove the desired `q_M>=0`.
- R26 therefore identifies the proof-level obstruction as missing
  inverse common--residual conditional coherence.  R18 raw conditional matrix
  positivity occurs before Gaussian stripping; R21 pure-residual rotational
  positivity does not control the coupled polynomial
  `(X_i-bar X)P_M(X_i)`.  The minimum OPEN is renamed
  `Residual-Corrected Flat Null-Square Hardy Gain`: prove/refute `A_M>=E_M`, or
  find an equivalent genuinely residual-corrected HS/matrix inequality whose
  first-order sign is `+c q_M t`, `c>0`.  `P_3K` remains disconnected and
  Gaussian rigidity remains OPEN.
- Added `flat_null_square_r26/audit_r26.py` and README.  The local SymPy audit
  passed the posterior pullback, flat parabolic jet, common-only wrong-sign
  coefficient, reverse-heat square identity, explicit
  `P_(-a)F_i` formula, and the `A_M=4q_M/3+E_M` decomposition/degree schema,
  printing `R26_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  The R24 and R25 audits were also rerun and
  `git diff --check` passed.  These are local algebraic checks only; they do not
  prove the conditional domination or a genuine full-exact orientation.

# 2026-09-06 — R27 same-factor conditional residual-jet contraction

- R27 reread the durable framework, worklog, R26 README/audit, and the recorded
  commit `7268c1f` before working.  The web-side analysis remained in the
  genuine full-exact iid class.  Independent residual sources, finite-prefix
  seeds, ordinary iid laws, and formal inverse candidates were treated only as
  proof-strategy objects, never as full-exact counterexamples.
- The R25 trace witness lifts to an unconditional `3x3` residual Gram identity:
  for `F_i=(X_i-bar X)P_M(X_i)`, flat orthogonality gives
  `L^3(F_i F_j)=(4q_M/9) delta_ij`.  Applying the R26 heat product identity to
  `G_i=P_(-a)F_i` yields the matrix decomposition
  `A=E+(4q_M/9)I_3`.  `A>=0` is from forward probability positivity, while
  `E>=0` is conditional on `H_M(L)>=0`; the two separate PSD facts do not imply
  `A>=E`.
- A single antisymmetric mode `F_-=(F_1-F_2)/sqrt(2)` is enough: its gap is
  `A_--E_-=4q_M/9`, and
  `F_1-F_2=(X_1-X_2)H_P` gives an explicit residual factorization.  The quotient
  `H_P` still depends on the common coordinate, so this is not reducible to
  pure-residual rotational positivity.  The strongest conditional bridge is a
  same-factor conditional contraction realizing all inverse derivative-jet
  sectors from the one forward vector `G_-`.
- R27 gives a strict no-go for the entire independent positive real residual-HS
  covariance-completion family.  If residual covariance satisfies the PSD
  damping budget `0<=C_perp<=tP_perp`, then `tr(C_perp)<=2t` and the flat-jet
  coefficient is `q_M(tr(C_perp)-2t)/2<=0`; maximal completion gives zero, not
  `+c q_M t`.  The same first-order obstruction holds for centered real sources
  of size `O(sqrt(t))` with the same budget, since higher cumulants are `o(t)`.
- The minimum OPEN is renamed `Same-Factor Conditional Residual-Jet
  Contraction`: prove/refute `A_-->=E_-` with the antisymmetric mode's common
  dependence handled explicitly, or find an equivalent cross-factor Schur/
  conditional contraction.  This remains a non-circular local bridge toward
  Gaussian rigidity; `P_3K` has no charge-to-residual-jet contraction and stays
  logically disconnected.  If this contraction is unavailable, stop expanding
  HS candidates and return to the R25 `Omega_K` infinite-tail modulus.
- Added `flat_null_square_r27/audit_r27.py` and README.  The local SymPy audit
  passed the flat Gram identity, matrix heat decomposition, antisymmetric
  factorization, and covariance-budget/no-go test, printing
  `R27_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  R24--R26 audits were rerun separately and passed;
  `git diff --check` remains required before commit.  These are local identity
  checks and do not prove the residual contraction, a full-exact orientation,
  or Gaussian rigidity.

# 2026-09-06 — R28 flat-shadow one-body tail-to-head collapse

- R28 reread the durable framework, worklog, R27 README/audit, and the recorded
  commit `cb3e70a` before working.  The web-side analysis stayed inside the
  genuine full-exact iid class.  The positive atomic shadow, toy laws, and
  formal moment vectors below were used only as structural/algebraic audit
  devices; none was promoted to a full-exact counterexample.
- At a flat boundary, let `nu_M` be the positive `M`-atomic shadow supported on
  the zeros of `P_M`, and `rho_M=P_a nu_M`.  For the antisymmetric mode
  `F_-=(F_1-F_2)/sqrt(2)` and `G_-=P_(-a)F_-`, heat intertwining gives
  `E[G_-(Y+sqrt(a)Z)|Y]=F_-(Y)=0`.  Hence the R27 derivative energy has the
  genuine positive realization `E_-=E_(rho_M^3)G_-^2`, as a conditional
  variance under the shadow Gaussian mixture.
- In pair coordinates `D=X_1-X_2`, `S=X_1+X_2`, `Y=X_3`, the exact identity is
  `Q=D^2/2+(S-2Y)^2/6`.  Exact `Q~chi^2_2` therefore supplies only a weighted
  scalar Laplace average for the pair fiber, not a pointwise conditional
  Loewner order.  Permutation symmetry still gives the rank-one facts
  `E[R|U,T]=0` and `E[RR^T|U,T]=T I_2`, but not the full derivative-jet
  contraction or the required shadow comparison.
- Define `R=P_(-a)P_M` and `W=P_(-a)(xP_M)=xR-aR'`.  The exact same-factor
  decomposition is `G_i=(2/3)W_i-(1/3)(X_j+X_k)R_i`.  Its antisymmetric
  Hoeffding sectors are orthogonal, giving
  `E G_-^2=(4/9)E W^2+(2/9)E R^2-(1/9)(E[XR])^2` for centered unit-variance
  product laws with the null means.  Since `mu` and `rho_M` match through
  `2M+1` moments, the residual two-body terms and derivative/noise remainder
  cancel exactly between them.  The remaining identity is
  `A_--E_-=(4/9)(E_mu W^2-E_rho_M W^2)` and, by the one-body heat product,
  `q_M=E_mu W^2-E_rho_M W^2`.
- This is a new full-exact-compatible proof-route no-go: any additional
  contraction acting only on the residual conditional/two-body Schur sector
  has zero net sign effect.  The correct minimum OPEN is now `Uniform
  Flat-Shadow One-Body Tail-to-Head Gain`, equivalently the R25 modulus
  `Omega_K->0`.  A conditional theorem is that this one-body norm monotonicity
  implies `q_M>=0`; it does not itself follow from exact radial law or from
  residual-sector positivity.  `P_3K` and Gaussian rigidity remain open and
  logically disconnected.
- Added `flat_null_square_r28/audit_r28.py` and README.  The local SymPy audit
  passed positive-shadow conditional-variance realization, same-factor heat
  decomposition, Hoeffding orthogonality/norm identity, moment-degree
  cancellation, and the pair-sum identity, printing
  `R28_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  No optimizer, numerical sweep, or remote computation
  was needed.  The audit verifies identities only; it does not prove the
  one-body norm monotonicity or Gaussian rigidity.

# 2026-09-06 — R29 flat-shadow one-body tail-to-head operator packaging

- R29 reread the durable framework, worklog, R28 README/audit, and the recorded
  commit `ea59523` before working.  The web-side analysis remained inside the
  genuine full-exact iid law class.  Atomic shadows, Gaussian prefixes, formal
  moments, and finite spectra were used only as algebraic audit devices; none
  was promoted to a full-exact counterexample.
- At the flat boundary, with `W=P_(-a)(xP_M)` and the common degree-`M+1`
  orthogonal direction, the one-body defect has the exact forward-Jacobi form
  `q_M=h_(M+1)(mu)-h_(M+1)(rho_M)` and
  `q_M=h_M(beta_(M+1)^mu-beta_(M+1)^rho_M)`.  This packages the R28 sign problem
  but does not determine its sign.
- The positive kernel `k_tau(x,y)=exp(-tau(x-y)^2/6)` has a positive feature
  expansion and trace one.  Since `sum_(i<j)(X_i-X_j)^2=3Q`, genuine exactness
  gives `Tr(T_tau^3)=E exp(-tau Q/2)=1/(1+tau)`.  Positive-spectrum algebra then
  gives `1/(1+tau)<=Tr(T_tau^2)<=1/sqrt(1+tau)` and
  `||T_tau||_op<=(1+tau)^(-1/3)`.  These scalar/radial facts are explicitly
  insufficient for the directional `W` norm gap because the infinite-dimensional
  smoothing operator has no uniform reverse coercivity.
- Matching the first `K` exact `Q` moments makes the radial transform difference
  `Z_mu(z)-(1+z)^(-1)` vanish to order `K+1`; under the uniform growth hypothesis
  this supports a conditional local exponential remainder estimate.  It still
  leaves the directional tail-to-head implication unproved.
- The minimum OPEN is now stated as `Uniform Flat-Shadow One-Body Tail-to-Head
  Gain`, with the falsifiable `Flat-Shadow Tail-Ejection Certificate`: a negative
  `q_M` must force a uniformly visible remote Hermite/Jacobi tail strong enough to
  imply `Omega_K->0`.  Ordinary Christoffel/Markov/Stieltjes, scalar radial,
  Schatten, and triangular Jacobi arguments are stop conditions.  `P_3K` remains
  disconnected and Gaussian rigidity remains OPEN.
- Added `flat_shadow_tail_gain_r29/audit_r29.py` and README.  The local SymPy
  audit passed the forward-Jacobi norm/beta identity, positive kernel/triangle
  trace exponent, Schatten algebra, and radial moment zero-order schema, printing
  `R29_TAIL_EJECTION_CERTIFICATE REMAINS OPEN` and `R29_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  The
  initial run caught and removed one invalid self-substitution assertion in the
  audit itself; the corrected run exited 0.  No optimizer, numerical sweep, or
  remote computation was used.

# 2026-09-06 — R30 sign-compatible augmented-adjoint locality

- R30 reread the durable framework, worklog, R29 README/audit, and the recorded
  commit `e08d8e6cef8b6c9b313b39241b791b99d0fdfe7c` before working.  The web-side
  result stayed inside the genuine full-exact iid class.  Formal moment vectors,
  Gaussian shadows, finite multipliers, and odd-control directions were used only
  for exact algebra and obstruction analysis, never as full-exact counterexamples.
- For `N=2M+2`, `d_0=...=d_(N-1)=0`, and `d_N=q_M`, define
  `G_n(v)=E_(v^tensor3)Q^n-2^n n!` and the path average
  `bar J_(n,j)=integral_0^1 partial_(v_j)G_n(r+s(m-r)) ds`.  The exact identity is
  `G_n(m)-G_n(r)=sum_j bar J_(n,j)d_j`; on a genuine exact law `G_n(m)=0`.
  The pivots are `bar J_(n,2n)=3(2/3)^n>0` and
  `bar J_(n,2n-1)=0`, with the first row reproducing
  `q_M=-G_(M+1)(r)/(3(2/3)^(M+1))`.
- Finite multipliers yield the exact telescoping skeleton
  `q_M=-sum lambda_n G_n(r)-sum_(j>N)c_jd_j` after `c_N=1`.  This is not an
  inequality: equality-only adjoints have no sign, and after the matched prefix
  each subsequent row leaves an odd-control direction.  Thus the equality route
  alone cannot eject a negative head defect into a positive remote tail.
- The sharpened target is an augmented certificate
  `q_M=P_K+R_K`, where `P_K` is a nonnegative combination of Hamburger/Jacobi
  slacks and `R_K` starts beyond `N_K->infinity` with a law-independent weighted
  dual bound.  Under that bound, uniform square-exponential Hermite growth would
  force `R_K->0` and hence `q_M>=0`; no actual `lambda,eta` construction was found.
  The minimum OPEN is therefore **Sign-Compatible Augmented Adjoint Locality**.
  `P_3K` remains disconnected from this locality problem.
- Added `flat_shadow_augmented_adjoint_r30/audit_r30.py` and README.  The exact
  SymPy audit covers the path identity for `n=2,3`, structural pivots, the first
  row, the finite multiplier skeleton, and the post-prefix odd-control dimension.
  The first run exposed and fixed a missing matched-prefix substitution in the
  finite skeleton check; the corrected run exited 0 and printed
  `R30_AUGMENTED_ADJOINT_IDENTITY PASSED`,
  `R30_SIGN_COMPATIBLE_LOCALITY REMAINS OPEN`, and `R30_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.
  No optimizer, SDP, large numerical sweep, or remote computation is used.

# 2026-09-06 — R31 Jacobi-slack adjoint completion

- R31 reread the durable framework, worklog, R30 README/audit, and the recorded
  commit `7198c91b18b1e76874a453af2e946047b5111363` before working.  The web-side
  result stayed inside the genuine full-exact iid class.  Jacobi prefixes,
  odd-control coordinates, and exact rational sign points were used only for
  structural audits, never as full-exact counterexamples.
- For `beta_n=B_n-S_(n-1)^2` and `h_n=beta_n h_(n-1)`, the top odd derivatives are
  `partial_(m_(2n-1))S_(n-1)=1/h_(n-1)` and
  `partial_(m_(2n-1))beta_n=-2S_(n-1)/h_(n-1)`.  In canonical coordinates
  `u_n=S_(n-1)/sqrt(B_n)`, `beta_n=B_n(1-u_n^2)`, so `u_n=0` and
  `|u_n|->1` are explicit pivot/leverage degeneracies.  The all-degree cubic
  pressure identity is
  `partial_(m_(2n-1))G_(n+1)=-n(n+1)(n+5)(2/3)^(n+1)m_3`.
- A same-level slack completion therefore requires a nonnegative multiplier only
  when `m_3 S_(n-1)<=0`; at `S_(n-1)=0` the slack has no first-order pivot.  A
  fixed one-step delayed slack also has no universal sign: at
  `s=m_3=1/20,c=S_2=-1`, the exact rational audit gives
  `beta_2>0`, `beta_3=1607/799>0`, `B_4=51765601/12839930>0`, but
  `partial_c beta_4=-5809029/5164898<0` and
  `partial_cG_4=-6392/3375<0`, forcing a negative next-slack multiplier.
  This is a sign-regularity obstruction on a positive algebraic prefix cone,
  not a probability-law counterexample.
- Adding path-averaged slack differences to the R30 adjoint does create a
  nonnegative full-law term `sum eta_j beta_j(mu)`, but exact regrouping leaves
  the shadow debt
  `D_K^sh=-sum lambda_nG_n(rho_M)-sum eta_j beta_j(rho_M)`.  Since the smoothed
  shadow has positive finite Jacobi slacks, this is not automatically a remote
  Hermite tail.  Thus gradient cancellation is not yet a value-level certificate.
- Rank count is no longer the main issue: equality rows and Jacobi slack rows
  match in number.  The remaining quantitative target is a multi-level positive
  normal-cone inf-sup with active ranks escaping to infinity, shadow balance, and
  a law-independent weighted dual norm.  Fixed active rank would imply finite
  support and contradict `Q~chi^2_2`, but rank escape alone does not bound the
  multipliers.  The minimum OPEN is now **Uniform Positive Jacobi Normal-Cone
  Locality**.  Gaussian rigidity and `P_3K` remain open/disconnected.
- Added `flat_shadow_jacobi_slack_r31/audit_r31.py` and README.  The exact SymPy
  audit covers the Jacobi odd block, canonical control formulas, the odd-pressure
  formula for `n=2,...,6`, the rational delayed-slack sign test, and the exact
  path-slack/shadow-debt regrouping.  The corrected run exited 0 and printed
  `R31_JACOBI_SLACK_STRUCTURE PASSED`,
  `R31_POSITIVE_ADJOINT_INF_SUP REMAINS OPEN`, and `R31_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.
  No optimizer, SDP, large sweep, or remote computation is used.

# 2026-09-06 — R32 global value-level remote adjoint locality

- R32 reread the durable framework, worklog, R31 README/audit, and the recorded
  commit `78ce2eacffcf2e216b1ba52b394f96cafa2f9415` before working.  The web-side
  result stayed inside the genuine full-exact iid class.  Finite viable prefixes,
  terminal flattening, and KKT/normal-cone systems were used only for proof
  structure and no-go analysis, never as counterexamples.
- For fixed `M`, finite `K`, a nondegenerate inverse-flat window, exact rows
  `G_1=...=G_K=0`, forward `H_K>=0`, and the recorded even-moment bounds, the
  viable moment set is compact and `q_M` continuous.  Hence
  `Omega_K=max(-q_M)_+` is attained.  When `K>=M+2`, `G_K` and the fixed head do
  not depend on the new odd moment; terminal flattening can therefore force
  `beta_K=0` without changing feasibility data relevant to the head.
- If a bad sequence retained a fixed singular forward Hankel rank, diagonal
  extraction, PSD, all fixed exact rows, and Carleman would yield a genuine
  full-exact limit with finite-support one-body law.  Then iid `Q` would have
  finite support, contradicting `Q~chi^2_2`.  Thus active forward ranks escape to
  infinity, and each fixed rank has a uniform positive margin at sufficiently
  deep prefixes.  This solves rank escape but not moving-rank conditioning.
- Finite-dimensional Fritz--John separation is available without assuming CQ;
  exact rows have independent top-even pivots, but no audited uniform CQ upgrades
  it to normalized KKT.  More importantly, standard normal-cone complementarity
  gives `eta_j beta_j(mu_K)=0` and `<Z,H_K>=0`.  Therefore local normal cones cancel
  gradients but cannot supply the positive value budget
  `P_K=sum eta_j beta_j(mu_K)`; at a terminally forced active face the multiplier
  is exactly zero, and inactive constraints have zero multiplier.
- This strictly excludes **Local Jacobi KKT/Normal-Cone Value Completion**:
  “bad extremizer + active-rank escape + local KKT” does not imply
  `q_M=P_K+R_K` with `P_K>=0` and `R_K->0`.  Adding more same-type Jacobi slacks
  cannot repair it without a new value-level telescoping identity.
- On a fixed compact flat window, the positive Gaussian shadow obeys a linear
  Jacobi normalization `beta_j(rho_M)/(j+1)<=C_W`, and normalized exact-Q shadow
  defects are uniformly bounded.  A remote exponentially weighted multiplier
  tail would therefore make shadow debt vanish by Cauchy--Schwarz.  The missing
  fact is that active-rank escape does not push the low equality costate to high
  degrees or provide a law-independent conic inf-sup.
- The new conditional closure is: if a normalized global value adjoint has all
  fixed/intermediate modes cancelled, its remaining Hermite dual coefficients
  start at `N_K->infinity` with a law-independent exponential weighted bound,
  and both Jacobi and exact-Q shadow debts obey the same remote estimate, then
  R12 tail tightness gives `Omega_K->0` and `q_M>=0`.  The true minimum OPEN is
  now **Global Value-Level Remote Adjoint Locality**.  Gaussian rigidity remains
  open and `P_3K` remains disconnected.
- Added `flat_shadow_normal_cone_r32/audit_r32.py` and README.  The exact local
  audit covers terminal odd independence/flattening, zero terminal KKT multiplier,
  complementarity no-value, the fixed-rank support contradiction note, Gaussian
  shadow normalization, and the weighted geometric-tail estimate.  The corrected
  run exited 0 and printed `R32_ACTIVE_RANK_ESCAPE PASSED`,
  `R32_LOCAL_NORMAL_CONE_VALUE_COMPLETION NO_GO`,
  `R32_REMOTE_EQUALITY_COSTATE LOCALITY REMAINS OPEN`, and
  `R32_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  No optimizer, SDP, large sweep, or remote computation
  is used.

# 2026-09-06 — R33 global value duality and shadow-compatible grading

- R33 reread the durable framework, worklog, R32 README/audit, and the recorded
  commit `d1af16e3b98a0fbb2f86bd46b444826da1c47201` before working.  The web-side
  analysis stayed inside the genuine full-exact iid class.  Finite Archimedean
  feasible sets, Positivstellensatz certificates, quotient coordinates, and flat
  shadows were used only for proof structure; no relaxed measure construction is
  a full-exact counterexample.
- For every fixed finite `K`, standard Archimedean value duality supplies a
  certificate for any strict upper bound `gamma>Omega_K`.  The exact equivalence
  is that `Omega_K->0` iff for every `epsilon>0` some finite certificate puts
  `epsilon+q_M` in the corresponding quadratic module plus exact ideal.  Thus
  unstructured global SOS existence is not the missing theorem; it is equivalent
  to the open orientation when required uniformly.
- With `m_0=1,m_1=0,m_2=1`, the same-factor rows satisfy
  `G_n=c_n m_(2n)-F_n`, `c_n=3(2/3)^n>0`, and have no `m_(2n-1)` term.  Recursive
  even elimination gives the formal odd-control quotient.  SOS is preserved under
  substitution because each square is substituted before squaring.  The exact
  `G_2,G_3,G_4` identities, pivots, odd-control retention, and substitution-SOS
  property are checked in the new local audit.
- The global equality representation has a polynomial gauge:
  `P+s^2G^2+(h-s^2G)G=P+hG`.  Hence individual equality costates and separate
  positive/equality shadow-debt pieces are not canonical.  More importantly, the
  positive flat shadow has `G_(M+1)(rho_M)=-c_(M+1)q_M`; exact quotient continuation
  changes the first unmatched even moment by exactly `q_M`.  For `q_M!=0`, the
  canonical quotient point is therefore off the actual positive shadow variety.
  The quotient removes equality costate but loses the positive shadow anchor.
- The invariant object is the total shadow evaluation.  If
  `gamma+q=P+E_Q+E_flat`, then `gamma+q(mu)=P(mu)` on a genuine feasible law and
  `gamma=P(rho_M)+E_Q(rho_M)` on the flat shadow.  The required new theorem is a
  shadow-compatible, gauge-invariant, Hermite-graded certificate: all fixed and
  intermediate Hermite content must vanish, while the remote coefficient norm is
  uniformly controlled and its shadow pairing tends to zero.  High constraint
  rank alone does not imply high Hermite grade; a linear measure-LP relaxation
  also loses same-factor rank-one structure.
- The minimum OPEN is now **Shadow-Compatible Graded Global Positivstellensatz**,
  equivalently gauge-invariant Global Value-Level Remote Adjoint Locality.  The
  Gaussian rigidity conclusion and the `P_3K` bridge remain OPEN and disconnected.
  If no new value-level identity appears, do not add more local Jacobi/KKT algebra.
- Added `flat_shadow_global_value_r33/audit_r33.py` and README.  The first run
  caught an overstrong local assertion that `m_7` must occur in the finite
  `G_2,...,G_4` substitution; corrected it to record `m_7` as a retained free odd
  control.  The corrected exact audit exited 0 and printed
  `R33_FINITE_GLOBAL_VALUE_DUALITY RECORDED`,
  `R33_Q_IDEAL_GAUGE_AND_SHADOW_OBSTRUCTION PASSED`,
  `R33_GRADED_REMOTE_LOCALITY REMAINS OPEN`, and
  `R33_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  No optimizer, SDP, degree search, large sweep, or
  remote computation was used.

# 2026-09-06 — R34 OU-graded total-shadow high-pass obstruction

- R34 first reread the durable framework, worklog, R33 README/audit, and the
  actual Git HEAD `c6fdf1844d4ed73a73e5b248985b0d97642220d0`, as required by the
  new local-record protocol.  The web-side task was restricted to one falsifiable
  subproblem and did not revisit R29--R33's stopped local routes.
- The OU/heat MGF algebra gives exact covariance under
  `a_t=1-t+ta`: `L_(a_t)^(P_t mu)=S_(sqrt(t))L_a^mu`.  The monic flat-null
  polynomial rescales as `P_(M,t)(x)=t^(M/2)P_M(x/sqrt(t))`, the first defect as
  `q_(M,t)=t^(M+1)q_M`, and a smoothed atomic shadow as
  `rho_(M,t)=P_t rho_M`.  Hermite coefficients scale by
  `a_ell(rho_(M,t))=t^(ell/2)a_ell(rho_M)`.
- For any finite global certificate, the gauge-invariant total shadow response
  `Theta_K(t)=P_K(rho_(M,t))+E_(Q,K)(rho_(M,t))` is exactly the constant `gamma_K`
  along the whole OU orbit.  Therefore an exact law-independent OU-regular
  remote-only expansion with strictly positive grade has no constant term and
  would force `gamma_K=0`.  The same argument rules out regular nonlinear
  expressions whose every monomial has positive total OU grade.
- Positive OU mixtures are necessarily low-pass because
  `m_ell=integral u^ell dnu(u)` is monotone decreasing on `[0,1]`; normalizing a
  grade to one forces the identity mixture.  Signed filters can annihilate low
  grades, but the monic Chebyshev minimax bound gives
  `||sigma||_TV>=2^(2N-1)` when the first `N` moments are killed and the `N`th is
  normalized.  Thus bounded linear OU/heat high-pass cannot supply the required
  uniform norm.  These are proof-mechanism obstructions, not full-exact laws or
  counterexamples.
- R34 strictly closes the route **OU/heat-semigroup linear grading of the total
  shadow evaluation**.  The remaining minimum OPEN is **Nonlinear
  Shadow-Compatible Graded Value Transgression**: use same-factor cubic/Fock
  homogeneous algebra before summing to the gauge-invariant total, allow only an
  independently controlled grade-zero defect tending to zero, and send the rest
  to high OU grade with a uniform norm.  Gaussian rigidity and the `P_3K` bridge
  remain OPEN and disconnected.
- Added `flat_shadow_ou_grading_r34/audit_r34.py` and README.  The first run
  caught an abstract shadow-evaluation substitution omission (`E_Q=gamma-P`)
  and a floating-point negative-exponent issue in the Chebyshev normalization;
  both were corrected.  The final exact audit exited 0 and printed
  `R34_FLAT_OU_COVARIANCE PASSED`,
  `R34_TOTAL_SHADOW_HIGH_PASS NO_GO`,
  `R34_SIGNED_OU_FILTER_NORM_BLOWUP RECORDED`,
  `R34_NONLINEAR_GRADED_TRANSGRESSION REMAINS OPEN`, and
  `R34_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  No optimizer, SDP, degree search, large sweep, or
  remote computation was used.

# 2026-09-06 — R35 Fock first-grade linearity and SOS anchor tax

- R35 reread the durable framework, worklog, R34 README/audit, and actual HEAD
  `88fd022c6e52d27a02139261b88c527cf1247284` before working.  The web-side
  analysis stayed inside the genuine full-exact positive iid class; Fock rings,
  flat shadows, and formal homogeneous paths were used only for proof structure,
  not as relaxed-law counterexamples.
- Let `N=2M+2` and let `b_j` be normalized Hermite/Fock coordinates of a genuine
  exact law and its positive flat shadow.  The first mismatch is
  `Delta_N=q_M/sqrt(N!)`.  For a same-factor cubic homogeneous equation, exact
  polarization gives `3B(H,S,S)+3B(H,H,S)+B(H,H,H)`.  With
  `ord_OU(H)=N`, the three pieces begin at grades `N,2N,3N`; hence the first
  mismatch is purely linear and cannot be canceled by a nonlinear cubic term.
- The lowest nonzero grade of a regular exact-ideal transgression
  `J=sum_d H_dF_d` is canonical:
  `[u^N]J(rho_u)=H_N(g)F_N(rho)`.  If the shadow remainder must start above
  `N` and `q_M!=0`, the grade-N ideal coefficient must vanish, so the exact
  ideal cannot carry the first head defect.
- For a finite positive square part `P=sum_r f_r^2`, put
  `c_r=f_r(g,xi_0)` and `d_r=partial_(b_N)f_r(g,xi_0)`.  First-grade value
  transport forces `sum_r c_rd_r=sqrt(N!)/2`, and Cauchy--Schwarz gives the
  exact anchor tax `P(g,xi_0)D_(N,K)^2>=N!/4`.  A uniform analytic factor norm
  bounds `D_(N,K)`, so a nonzero `q_M` forces a K-independent positive anchor
  budget.  This conflicts with both a vanishing grade-zero defect and a
  K-uniform norm.  The scalar completion `x=(c+x)^2/(2c)-c/2-x^2/(2c)` is the
  sharp one-dimensional analogue.
- R35 strictly closes **Uniformly Bounded Finite Fock--SOS Graded Transgression**
  on the `q_M!=0` branch.  The remaining minimum OPEN is
  **Constraint-Coupled Non-SOS Graded Value Transgression**: positivity must
  emerge only after coupling signed homogeneous pieces to the genuine
  same-factor exact manifold and probability cone, while retaining a vanishing
  grade-zero defect and uniform remote norm.  Gaussian rigidity and the `P_3K`
  bridge remain OPEN and disconnected.
- Added `flat_shadow_fock_transgression_r35/audit_r35.py` and README.  The first
  run exposed a mutable SymPy tuple issue and the zero-polynomial convention in
  the grade helper; both were corrected.  The final exact audit exited 0 and
  printed `R35_CUBIC_FIRST_GRADE_LINEARITY PASSED`,
  `R35_FIRST_IDEAL_GRADE_CANONICAL PASSED`,
  `R35_FOCK_SOS_ANCHOR_TAX PASSED`,
  `R35_BOUNDED_FOCK_SOS_TRANSGRESSION NO_GO`,
  `R35_CONSTRAINT_COUPLED_TRANSGRESSION REMAINS OPEN`, and
  `R35_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  No optimizer, SDP, degree search, large sweep, or
  remote computation was used.

# 2026-09-06 — R36 one-body Laguerre–Hoeffding carrier obstruction

- R36 began by rereading the durable theory framework, worklog, R35 README/audit,
  and actual Git HEAD `3e537e8`, then stayed inside the genuine full-exact positive
  iid class.  The target was a remote high-Laguerre one-body carrier for the first
  fixed Hermite/Fock mismatch; R29–R35 were not rerun.
- For `Phi_n=L_n((X1^2+X2^2+X3^2)/2)`, the exact iid radial variable is exponential,
  so the Laguerre values are orthonormal.  The order-three Hoeffding decomposition
  gives `1=3||h1||^2+3||h2||^2+||h3||^2`, while the one-body norm has the exact
  five-copy shared-coordinate representation `E[Phi123 Phi145]`.
- At the Gaussian anchor, exact angular Hermite–Laguerre averaging and conditional
  Hermite contraction give `k_n^gamma=kappa_n h_(2n)`, with
  `kappa_n=(-1)^n sqrt((2n)!)/(2^n n!)(2/3)^n` and
  `||k_n^gamma||^2=binom(2n,n)/9^n`.  Thus the one-body anchor decays
  exponentially.
- With `N=2M+2` and `Delta_N=q_M/sqrt(N!)`, the five-copy derivative is exactly
  `dot A_(n,N)=3(S_(n,N)+4L_(n,N))`.  The Hermite triple coefficient and the
  Cauchy bound `|L|<=|kappa_n|` imply, for fixed `N`, a bound
  `C_N(1+n^(N/2))(2/3)^n`, so fixed-head sensitivity also collapses.
- Therefore an ordinary `l2`-bounded remote one-body Laguerre carrier, and bounded
  nonlinear recombinations with uniformly bounded outer gradient, cannot transport
  a nonzero fixed head.  R36 closes this one-body proof mechanism only; it does not
  exclude a degenerate two-body Hoeffding or cross-grade pair/tensor carrier.
- Added `flat_shadow_hoeffding_transgression_r36/audit_r36.py` and README.  The exact
  audit exited 0 with markers `R36_HOEFFDING_VALUE_IDENTITY PASSED`,
  `R36_GAUSSIAN_ONE_BODY_PROJECTION PASSED`,
  `R36_FIXED_HEAD_SENSITIVITY_COLLAPSE PASSED`,
  `R36_REMOTE_ONE_BODY_CARRIER NO_GO`,
  `R36_TWO_BODY CARRIER REMAINS OPEN`, and `R36_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  No optimizer,
  SDP, numerical sweep, or remote computation was used.

# 2026-09-06 — R37 two-body Laguerre–Hoeffding Gaussian anchor

- The browser-side control layer remained temporarily unavailable, while the
  bridge/connector doctor stayed green.  To make substantive progress without
  inventing a web review, R37 completed only the local exact anchor calculation
  already identified by R36; the fixed-head derivative is explicitly deferred to
  web review.
- With `S=(X1+X2)/sqrt(2)` and `D=(X1-X2)/sqrt(2)`, exact conditional Gaussian
  integration gives
  `sum_n E[L_n(T)|X1,X2]z^n`
  `=(1-z)^(-1/2)(1-z/3)^(-1/2)` times
  `exp(-zD^2/(2(1-z))-zS^2/(6(1-z/3)))`.
  The corresponding finite polynomial formula was checked against direct
  Gaussian marginalization for `n=0,...,4`.
- Writing `w_j=binom(2j,j)/4^j`, the exact pair projection norm is
  `||p_n||^2=sum_b 9^(-b)w_(n-b)w_b`, with generating function
  `((1-z)(1-z/9))^(-1/2)`.  After subtracting the two one-body projections,
  `B_n^gamma=sum_b9^(-b)w_(n-b)w_b-2(4/9)^nw_n`.
- The `z=1` singularity gives
  `B_n^gamma~(3/(2sqrt(2)))w_n~3/(2sqrt(2pi n))`.  Therefore the degenerate
  two-body anchor loses only polynomially, not exponentially: it genuinely
  bypasses the R36 one-body `(2/3)^n` information loss.
- Added `flat_shadow_hoeffding_transgression_r37/audit_r37.py` and README.  The
  exact audit exited 0 with markers `R37_TWO_BODY_CONDITIONAL_PROJECTION PASSED`,
  `R37_TWO_BODY_DEGENERATE_NORM PASSED`,
  `R37_TWO_BODY_ANCHOR_POLYNOMIAL_DECAY PASSED`,
  `R37_TWO_BODY_HEAD_SENSITIVITY REQUIRES WEB_REVIEW`,
  `R37_CONSTRAINT_COUPLED_TRANSGRESSION REMAINS OPEN`, and
`R37_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  No optimizer, SDP, numerical sweep, or remote
computation was used.

# 2026-09-06 — R37 web review: two-body head sensitivity passes screening

- The same project conversation reread `THEORY_ROUTE_FRAMEWORK.md`,
  `PROJECT_WORKLOG_APPEND.md`, the R36/R37 README files and audits, and verified
  the nested repository HEAD `370dd03bf289f7f73b2624c2d4936018b446649d` before
  doing new theory work.
- The web review retained every term in the derivative of the law-dependent
  degenerate two-body Hoeffding energy: the base `mu^2` weight, conditional
  projection, one-body subtractions, and mean correction.  Gaussian degeneracy
  and chaos-order orthogonality then reduce the full derivative to
  `partial_(b_N)B_n|_gamma = 2 E[h_N(X1) h_(2,n)^2]`.
- It supplied the normalized `S,D` coefficients and the exact finite
  triple-Hermite sum for `D_(n,2m)`.  The reviewed asymptotic is
  `D_(n,2m) ~ 3sqrt((2m)!)/(sqrt(2pi)(m!)^2) n^(m-1/2)`, while
  `B_n^gamma ~ 3/(2sqrt(2pi n))`.
- Thus the two-body sector passes the R36 carrier-window screen: after
  `lambda_(n,2m)=sqrt((2m)!)/D_(n,2m)`, the fixed head is normalized to a
  constant and the Gaussian anchor is `~(m!)^2 n^(-m)/2`.  This is not yet a
  transgression theorem: uniform multi-grade cancellation, conditioning, and
  remote-tail control remain open.  Gaussian rigidity and the `P_3K` bridge
  remain disconnected.
- The local preview already matched the web values
  `D_(1,2)=2sqrt(2)/9`, `D_(2,2)=28sqrt(2)/27`, and `D_(2,4)=2sqrt(6)/3`.

# 2026-09-06 — R38 exact follow-up audit

- Added `flat_shadow_hoeffding_transgression_r38/audit_r38.py` and README to
  check only the new finite identities from the R37 review.  The audit does
  not treat `dmu=(1+epsilon*g)d_gamma` as a probability counterexample.
- Exact checks passed for the normalized pair expansion, complete derivative
  decomposition, cancellation/orthogonality of conditional-kernel,
  subtraction, and mean derivatives, and the finite Hermite sum.  The exact
  regression values for `n=1,...,4` and `N=2,4` include the three values above.
- Output:
  `R38_TWO_BODY_NORMALIZED_EXPANSION PASSED`,
  `R38_TWO_BODY_FULL_DERIVATIVE PASSED`,
  `R38_INTERNAL_HOEFFDING_DERIVATIVES_CANCEL PASSED`,
  `R38_FIXED_HEAD_FINITE_SUM PASSED`,
  `R38_TWO_BODY_CARRIER_WINDOW WEB_REVIEWED_LOCAL_FINITE_CHECK PASSED`,
  `R38_MULTI_GRADE_CONDITIONING REMAINS OPEN`, and
  `R38_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.
- No optimizer, SDP, numerical sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote
  computation was used.  The next minimum OPEN is uniform multi-grade
  cancellation for the normalized two-body carrier family.

# 2026-09-06 — R39 first two-grade cancellation and mixed-Hessian bottleneck

- The web side reread the updated local framework, worklog, R36/R37/R38 audits,
  and verified HEAD `4184d3fd884ac6cbe5106e35cfcb05a77a6368ed` before deriving
  the next result.
- For fixed `N=2m`, parity and the centered variance-one constraints imply that
  the grade-`N` and grade-`N+2` full/shadow difference channels are the linear
  responses `D_(n,N)Delta_N` and `D_(n,N+2)Delta_(N+2)`.  Since
  `D_(n,2r)~alpha_r n^(r-1/2)`, two sufficiently separated carrier ranks give
  exact weights preserving grade `N` and cancelling grade `N+2`; for
  `n_1=R,n_2=R^2`, the interpolation weights remain mild.
- On genuine full-exact iid laws, `1/3-B_n=A_n+C_n^(3)/3>=0` lets the signed
  two-carrier combination be rewritten as a nonnegative constraint-coupled
  part minus a defect tending to zero.  Its Gaussian anchor tends to zero and
  its grade-`N` head remains `q_M`, while parity removes the odd grades.  This
  is a finite two-grade cancellation lemma, not a completed remote
  transgression and not an ambient SOS identity.
- At grade `N+4`, the full second law-functional derivative has five classes of
  terms: base-measure weight, two first kernel/measure cross terms, the product
  of first internal derivatives, and the mixed second internal derivative.
  For `N>=6`, `b_4=0` leaves the independent mixed-Hessian channel
  `H_(n;N+1,3)b_3Delta_(N+1)` alongside the linear `D_(n,N+4)Delta_(N+4)`;
  `N=4` has an additional `-H_(n;4,4)Delta_4^2/2` resonance.
- Thus a 3x3 linear Vandermonde is not the true obstruction.  The minimum OPEN
  is now the **Mixed-Hessian Two-Body Response Lemma**: determine the
  asymptotic span/sign/conditioning of `H_(n;2m+1,3)` relative to the linear
  response rows.  Gaussian rigidity and the `P_3K` bridge remain disconnected.

# 2026-09-06 — R39 local exact audit

- Added `flat_shadow_multigrade_r39/audit_r39.py` and README.  It checks exact
  two-grade weights, the full-exact Hoeffding complement at the Gaussian
  anchor, an independent affine-density expansion of the complete mixed
  second derivative, and the `N+4` Taylor channel bookkeeping.
- Output:
  `R39_TWO_GRADE_EXACT_CANCELLATION PASSED`,
  `R39_CONSTRAINT_COUPLED_POSITIVITY PASSED`,
  `R39_SECOND_DERIVATIVE_DECOMPOSITION PASSED`,
  `R39_GRADE_NPLUS4_CHANNEL_DECOMPOSITION PASSED`,
  `R39_LINEAR_VANDERMONDE_NOT_THE_OBSTRUCTION RECORDED`,
  `R39_MIXED_HESSIAN_RESPONSE REMAINS OPEN`, and
  `R39_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.
- No optimizer, SDP, numerical sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote
  computation was used.

# 2026-09-06 — R40 mixed-Hessian asymptotic review and local exact audit

- The same project webpage first read the latest route records and R36–R39
  audits, then supplied a finite Hermite representation for
  `K_(n,m)=D^2B_n(gamma)[h_(2m+1),h_3]` and an asymptotic candidate.  With
  `chi_m=sqrt(binomial(2m+4,3))` and
  `rho_m=sqrt(3(m+1))(2m+1)(4m+5)/(4(m+2))`, it claims
  `K_(n,m)+chi_m D_(n,2m+4)-rho_m D_(n,2m+2)=O_m(n^(m-1/2))`.
  Thus the leading mixed row is absorbed by the existing `N+4` and `N+2`
  linear rows; the unresolved object is the normalized residue `S_(n,m)` and
  its limit/first nonconstant `1/n` term.
- `flat_shadow_mixed_hessian_r40/audit_r40.py` now extracts the `epsilon delta`
  coefficient from the affine density expansion and independently evaluates
  the complete five-term second law-functional derivative, including
  base-measure, conditional, subtraction, mean, and mixed-internal terms.  It
  also checks the three exact chaos cancellations and the two `S,D` leading
  component coefficients used by the web argument.
- Exact target-channel regression for `N=6` (`m=3`) is
  `K_(1,3)=0`, `K_(2,3)=0`,
  `K_(3,3)=-100sqrt(210)/81`, and
  `K_(4,3)=-25264sqrt(210)/2187`, and
  `K_(5,3)=-320648sqrt(210)/6561`.
- The additional web candidate `K_(4,4)=-25808sqrt(105)/2187` also passes.
- Exact markers are `R40_CHAOS_CROSS_TERMS_CANCEL PASSED`,
  `R40_LEADING_COMPONENT_COEFFICIENTS PASSED`,
  `R40_MIXED_HESSIAN_FINITE_REGRESSION PASSED`, and
  `R40_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.
- These values are recorded only as finite evidence.  The asymptotic order and
  response-rank relation to `D_(n,2m+4)` remain explicitly
  `R40_ASYMPTOTIC_RESPONSE WEB_CANDIDATE_RECORDED_UNAUDITED`; no transgression or no-go is
  inferred from the table.  No optimizer, SDP, numerical sweep, relaxed
  measure-LP, or remote computation was used.

- Starting with this round, the route framework and outline are maintained
  locally in `THEORY_ROUTE_FRAMEWORK.md` and this append-only worklog, and are
  committed to Git.  Before each new web-side research round, the prompt must
  explicitly require reading the latest framework/worklog and the relevant
  local audit records; after the reply, only verified new conclusions are
 appended here.  This persistence rule does not change the route or its
 evidence boundaries.

# 2026-09-06 — R41 residue block formula and m=3 conditioning audit

- The same project webpage first read the route framework, append-only log,
  and R36–R40 audit records, then reduced the R40 residue to an exact finite
  `S,D` block sum `T_(r,j)` over shift `s` and carrier index `b`.  It supplied
  the candidate
  `sigma_m=-sqrt(6(2m+1))(160m^3+312m^2+140m+15)/(64(m+1)(m+2))<0`
  for `m>=3`.
- For `m=3`, it supplied
  `S_(n,3)=-7563sqrt(42)/1280+(6327sqrt(42)/512)n^(-1)+O(n^(-2))`,
  hence `r_3=1<=m-1`.  The N+4 mixed-Hessian condition therefore does not
  produce a family-specific weighted-conditioning no-go at the lowest case;
  this remains a finite-grade conditional continuation, not full
  transgression.
- Added `flat_shadow_residue_r41/audit_r41.py` and README.  The local exact
  audit checks the new block formula against direct Gaussian projection, the
  `q_(m,2)` and `q_(m,4)` projections, exact specializations/sign of the
  proposed `sigma_m`, the `m=3` quotient algebra, exact `S_(3,3)`, `S_(4,3)`,
  `S_(5,3)` regressions, and the 4x4 `1,n,n^2,n^(-1)` determinant identity.
- Exact markers passed:
  `R41_BLOCK_FORMULA_FINITE_CHECK PASSED`,
  `R41_Q_COEFFICIENTS_FINITE_CHECK PASSED`,
  `R41_SIGMA_SPECIALIZATION_AND_SIGN PASSED`,
  `R41_M3_FIRST_VARIATION_ALGEBRA PASSED`,
  `R41_EXACT_RESIDUE_REGRESSION PASSED`,
  `R41_4X4_DETERMINANT_IDENTITY PASSED`, and
  `R41_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  The script explicitly retains
  `R41_GENERAL_M_FIRST_VARIATION REMAINS OPEN` and
  `R41_ASYMPTOTIC_CLAIMS REMAIN_WEB_DERIVED_UNAUDITED`.
- The general `kappa_m` nonzero question, higher grades, uniform weighted
  conditioning, and the positive-shadow remote tail remain open.  No
  optimizer, SDP, numerical sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote computation
  was used.

# 2026-09-06 — R42 bivariate generators and m=4 residue audit

- The same project webpage first read the R36–R41 local records and verified
  nested-repository HEAD `1b5d2ac`.  It reported no missing contribution in the
  R41 assembly at the target order: fixed-chaos one-body subtraction is
  `poly(n)(2/3)^n` and therefore exponentially small; `C^(1)`'s first
  correction and `C^(3)`'s leading term enter `n^(m-3/2)`; `C^(j>=5)` is lower
  order.  The `q_(m,2)`, `q_(m,4)`, `q_(m,6)` and `D_(n,2m+2)` correction order
  bookkeeping was made explicit.
- The web review supplied an exact bivariate generating function for the
  `T_(r,j)` blocks and an exact generating function for `dot p_3`.  These are
  recorded in the route framework as R42.1–R42.5-style identities.  It also
  completed the `m=4` singular assembly:

  `sigma_4=-15807sqrt(6)/640`,
  `kappa_4=38325sqrt(6)/512>0`, hence `r_4=1`.

  The resulting `N+4` weighted scale is `R^(-5/2)`, so this finite-grade step
  does not produce a family-specific no-go.  The result remains conditional on
  the web-derived singular expansions and does not prove full transgression.
- Added `flat_shadow_residue_r42/audit_r42.py` and README.  The local audit
  checks the bivariate block generator against the exact double finite sum,
  checks the `dot p_3` generator against direct Gaussian marginalization,
  checks the `m=4` cancelled-polynomial coefficients `q_2,q_4,q_6`, verifies
  the supplied numerator/denominator quotient algebra for `sigma_4,kappa_4`,
  and verifies the new exact regression
  `S_(4,4)=-11639sqrt(6)/1179`.
- Audit output:
  `R42_BLOCK_BIVARIATE_GENERATOR PASSED`,
  `R42_DOTP3_GENERATOR PASSED`,
  `R42_M4_Q_COEFFICIENTS PASSED`,
  `R42_M4_RESIDUE_QUOTIENT_ALGEBRA PASSED`,
  `R42_M4_EXACT_RESIDUE_REGRESSION PASSED`,
  `R42_M4_WEIGHTED_CONDITIONING PASSED`,
  `R42_M4_SINGULAR_EXPANSIONS REMAIN_WEB_DERIVED_UNAUDITED`,
  `R42_GENERAL_M_KAPPA REMAINS OPEN`, and `R42_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.
- The current smallest OPEN is now the general `m>=5` first residue variation
  lemma.  Constraint-Coupled Non-SOS Graded Value Transgression and Gaussian
  rigidity remain OPEN; the `P_3K` bridge remains fully disconnected.  Before
  the next web round, the prompt must require reading the updated framework,
  this append-only log, and R36–R42 local audit records.  No optimizer, SDP,
  numerical sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote computation was used.

# 2026-09-06 — R43 local m=5 first-residue-variation audit

- The web-side R43 request was placed once in the same project conversation and
  later completed with the same `m=5` coefficients as the local calculation.
  While its response was pending, the local audit used only the exact R42.3
  bivariate block generator and R42.5 `dot p_3` generator; no duplicate web
  request was sent.
- The exact m=5 cancelled-chaos coefficients are
  `q_(5,2)=33/16`, `q_(5,4)=23sqrt(11)/8`, and `q_(5,6)=47sqrt(33)/16`.
  The local algebraic singular extraction through the residue scale gives
  `sigma_5=-9505sqrt(66)/896` and
  `kappa_5=18887sqrt(66)/448>0`, hence `r_5=1`.
- The residue numerator coefficients were independently assembled as
  `-5703sqrt(231)/(3584sqrt(pi))` at `n^(9/2)` and
  `3711849sqrt(231)/(573440sqrt(pi))` at `n^(7/2)`.  The `D_(n,10)`
  denominator coefficients used were `3sqrt(14)/(40sqrt(pi))` and
  `-9sqrt(14)/(1280sqrt(pi))`.
- Added `flat_shadow_residue_r43/audit_r43.py` and README.  The script checks
  the exact block generator against finite Hermite contractions, checks the
  raw `dot p_3` generator against direct Gaussian marginalization, checks the
  full genuine finite regression at `(n,m)=(5,5)`, verifies the m=5 algebraic
  assembly, and checks the `1,n,n^2,n^(-1)` response determinant together with
  the `R^(-7/2)` coefficient scale.  The finite regression is
  `K_(5,5)=-219200sqrt(462)/6561`,
  `D_(5,10)=91916sqrt(7)/2187`,
  `D_(5,12)=46160sqrt(231)/6561`,
  `D_(5,14)=15400sqrt(858)/6561`, and
  `S_(5,5)=-687675sqrt(66)/160853`.
- The local output retains `R43_GENERAL_M_KAPPA REMAINS OPEN` and explicitly
  labels the algebraic `u=1` expansion scope; the `u=9`/`z=3` pieces are
  exponentially small for fixed `m`.  No optimizer, SDP, numerical sweep,
  relaxed measure-LP, or remote computation was used.

- Since `r_5=1<=m-1`, the N+4 two-body mixed row still has extra actual
  coefficient scale `R^(1-5+1/2)=R^(-7/2)->0`; this is only a finite-grade
  conditional continuation.  Higher grades, arbitrary-depth conditioning,
  the positive remote tail, the global transgression, Gaussian rigidity, and
  the `P_3K` bridge remain open.  The current smallest residue OPEN is now
  the general `m>=6` first-variation lemma, ideally via a closed rational
  formula for `kappa_m`; the three checked cases `m=3,4,5` are not extrapolated.

# 2026-09-06 — R44 general first-residue variation audit

- The same project webpage first read the local route framework, append-only
  worklog, and R36–R43 audit records, and verified nested-repository HEAD
  `5855acd94a5d4312d456af68bc3a26829a3cefa8`.  It then returned a general
  fixed-`m` formula, rather than interpolating the three earlier cases:

  `kappa_m = sqrt(6(2m+1)) *
  (608m^4+672m^3-386m^2-207m-27)/(256(m+1)(m+2))`.

- Added `flat_shadow_residue_r44/audit_r44.py` and README.  The local audit
  independently checks the `A_1,A_2` Darboux/Gamma-ratio algebra, the exact
  `j=1,2,3` diagonal moments, the general `q_(m,2),q_(m,4),q_(m,6)` formulas,
  exact `C^(1)`/`C^(3)` pole cancellations, the C-sector constant-term
  identities, positivity of the proposed polynomial, the existing `m=3,4,5`
  kappa values, and the full fixed-`m` residue quotient reassembly for
  `m=3,4,5` using the R43 exact generator machinery.

- Output:
  `R44_GENERAL_DARBOUX_COEFFICIENT_ALGEBRA PASSED`,
  `R44_GENERAL_BLOCK_MOMENTS PASSED`,
  `R44_C_SECTOR_POLE_CANCELLATION PASSED`,
  `R44_GENERAL_Q_FORMULAS PASSED`,
  `R44_C_CONSTANT_TERM_IDENTITIES PASSED`,
  `R44_GENERAL_KAPPA_SPECIALIZATIONS PASSED`,
  `R44_GENERAL_KAPPA_POSITIVITY PASSED`,
  `R44_FIXED_M_ASSEMBLY m=3,4,5 PASSED`,
  `R44_NPLUS4_WEIGHTED_CONDITIONING PASSED`,
  `R44_NPLUS6_MULTI_RESPONSE REMAINS OPEN`, and
  `R44_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.

- The numerator polynomial is strictly positive for every integer `m>=1`:
  `608m^4-386m^2>=222` and `672m^3-207m>=465`, hence the full numerator is
  at least `660`.  Thus the fixed-`m` first-variation conclusion is
  `kappa_m>0` and `r_m=1` for every admissible `m>=3`.

- The N+4 continuation is now closed at the fixed-`m` algebraic level and
  still has no family-specific weighted-conditioning no-go.  This does not
  establish a uniform-in-`m` remainder theorem or a full transgression.  The
  current smallest OPEN is **Grade-(N+6) Multi-Response Conditioning Lemma**:
  new `D_(n,N+6)`, `H_(n;N+3,3)`, `H_(n;N+1,5)`, and third-Gateaux response
  channels must be controlled together.  Gaussian rigidity, the accumulated
  grade-zero debt, the positive flat-shadow remote tail, and the `P_3K` bridge
  remain open.

- No optimizer, SDP, numerical sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote
  computation was used.  Before the next web round, the prompt must require
  reading the updated framework, worklog, and R36–R44 local audit records.

# 2026-09-06 — R45 finite N+6 resonance audit

- The same project webpage completed the R45 review after reading the local
  framework, append-only worklog, and R36–R44 audit records, and verified
  nested-repository HEAD `73f063031a0362d9deb49b3e50305c3339252398`.
- The web result corrected the lowest-grade bookkeeping.  For genuine
  full-exact laws, the degree-six same-factor Fock relation is
  `b_6=(7sqrt(5)/10)b_3^2`.  For `N>6`, the `H_(n;N,6)` and third-Gateaux
  contributions can therefore be combined.  For the resonant minimum `N=6`,
  `b_6` is itself a mismatch coefficient and an additional term
  `-(1/2)H_(n;6,6)Delta_6^2` remains.  Thus the generic case has four
  law-monomial channels, while `N=6` has five.
- Added `flat_shadow_residue_r45/audit_r45.py` and README.  The exact audit
  checks the degree-six angular coefficients, the complete four/five/six-copy
  law-functional third variation, and the full law-dependent Hoeffding
  regressions at `(n,m)=(3,3)`.
- Exact output:
  `R45_DEGREE6_FOCK_RELATION PASSED`,
  `R45_FULL_LAW_THIRD_VARIATION PASSED`,
  `R45_M3_HESSIAN_REGRESSIONS PASSED`,
  `R45_N6_RESONANCE_COMBINATION PASSED`,
  `R45_NPLUS6_QUOTIENT_RANK REMAINS OPEN`, and
  `R45_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.
- The finite third-variation coefficients were
  `K4=376sqrt(5)/729`, `K5=196sqrt(5)/729`, and
  `K6=-28sqrt(5)/81`, giving
  `(1/2)D^3B_3[h_6,h_3,h_3]=-268sqrt(5)/729`.
  The exact Hessian regressions were
  `H_(3;9,3)=-32sqrt(105)/81`,
  `H_(3;7,5)=-800sqrt(42)/729`, and
  `H_(3;6,6)=5560/729`; hence
  `J_(3,3)=1208sqrt(5)/243`.
- The audit deliberately does not claim the general channel-exhaustion
  formula, the quotient matrices `C_m`/`C_3^res`, their determinants, uniform
  conditioning, or full transgression.  The current smallest OPEN is now
  **N=6 Second-Residue Rank Lemma**: compute the lowest resonance quotient rank,
  beginning with whether it is `1` or `>=2`.
- Before the next web round, require reading the updated framework, worklog,
  and R36–R45 local audit records.  No optimizer, SDP, sweep, relaxed
  measure-LP, or remote computation was used.

## R46 — N=6 second-residue rank lower bound (2026-09-06)

- The right-side web session did not synchronize a final R46 answer; it remained
  at the tool-call state.  I therefore continued from the audited R45 formulas
  locally and did not resend the prompt.
- Added `flat_shadow_residue_r46/audit_r46.py` and README.  The audit derives the
  `q=5` conditional-score generator, checks it against direct Gaussian
  marginalization at `(n,m)=(3,3)`, and assembles the `H_(n;7,5)` raw block row.
- To avoid an invalid extrapolation of R43's low-order helper, the R46 script
  retains the complete analytic Taylor tail at `u=1` to the order needed for
  the Laurent quotient.  It reduces the `H_(n;9,3)` and `H_(n;7,5)` rows against
  `{D_(n,12)/D_(n,6), D_(n,10)/D_(n,6), D_(n,8)/D_(n,6), 1,
  S_(n,3)-sigma_3}`.
- Exact output:
  `R46_H75_GENERATOR_FINITE_CHECK PASSED`;
  `c_(3,2)=-3970123318809sqrt(21)/294859571200`;
  `c_(3,3)=59155049844691sqrt(21)/8491955650560`;
  `c_(5,2)=1176526610081sqrt(210)/294859571200`;
  `c_(5,3)=-2147390944445sqrt(210)/566130376704`; and the minor is
  `72543614649557486062397sqrt(10)/148407681470693376000`, nonzero.
- Therefore the first two quotient rows already prove the finite fixed-`m`
  lower bound `rank(C_3^res) >= 2`.  The full four-row matrix, its determinant,
  weighted carrier norm, and any no-go conclusion remain OPEN.
- The formal Hermite directions remain OU Taylor coefficient extractors, not
  probability counterexamples; positive flat shadows are not treated as
  full-exact laws.  No optimizer, SDP, sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote
  computation was used.
- Before the next web round, require reading the updated framework, worklog,
  and R36–R46 local audit records.

## R46 correction and web-result reconciliation (2026-09-06)

- The right-side web task had in fact completed.  Its final answer confirms
  `rank C_{3,{n^-2,n^-3}}^{res}=2`, hence `rank C_3^{res} >= 2`, while keeping
  the full four-row matrix, weighted inverse, and no-go statement OPEN.
- The first local R46 run had used an insufficient central-binomial/Gamma-ratio
  helper.  Replaced it with exact formal y-series algebra for the full
  half-integer Gamma ratio; the central test through order four is
  `1-1/(8n)+1/(128n^2)+5/(1024n^3)-21/(32768n^4)`.
- Re-running `flat_shadow_residue_r46/audit_r46.py` after the correction gives
  `c_(3,2)=-3967045866009sqrt(21)/294859571200`,
  `c_(3,3)=350225725881sqrt(21)/49660559360`,
  `c_(5,2)=1178920184481sqrt(210)/294859571200`, and
  `c_(5,3)=-184569690489sqrt(210)/49660559360`; the first-two-row minor is
  `4530725172882348802803sqrt(10)/9893845431379558400 != 0`.
- The local `c_(3,2)` and `c_(5,2)` agree with the webpage transcript.  The
  webpage's displayed `n^-3` entries differ from the corrected local
  coefficient extraction, so this is recorded as an explicit coefficient-level
  reconciliation OPEN rather than silently merging the transcripts.  The rank
  lower bound itself is unchanged and independently nonzero.
- The next smallest web-side question is the
  `N=6 Second-Residue Constraint-Coupling / Weighted-Inverse Lemma`: determine
  whether `b_3 Delta_9` and `b_5 Delta_7` remain independently activatable on the
  genuine full-exact same-factor manifold.  Do not promote response rank to a
  weighted no-go; preserve the distinction between full-exact, formal Gateaux,
  and positive flat-shadow levels.

## R47 — N=6 constraint-coupling exact reduction (2026-09-06)

- The webpage R47 round completed after reading the corrected local R46
  records.  Its main conclusion is that finite same-factor/Fock/Hermite
  constraints do not collapse `b_3 Delta_9` and `b_5 Delta_7` to one
  direction; they give an invertible coordinate change to
  `(Delta_10,Delta_12)` plus a fixed `Delta_6^2` term.
- For the rank-two flat shadow, `U^2=tU+1`, `EU=0`, `EU^2=1`, and the matched
  `b_4` head gives `t^2=2`.  The exact recurrence is
  `m_(k+2)=t*m_(k+1)+m_k`; the audited heads include
  `EH_5=-6t`, `EH_6=-4`, `EH_7=36t`, `EH_9=-232t`,
  `EH_10=-432`, and `EH_12=2848`.
- Added `flat_shadow_constraint_coupling_r47/audit_r47.py` and README.  The
  script independently reconstructs the angular constant terms and verifies
  the genuine full-exact identities
  `b_10=sqrt(30)b_3b_7+(17sqrt(7)/14)b_5^2` and
  `b_12=(10sqrt(55)/11)b_3b_9+(21sqrt(22)/11)b_5b_7
  -(369sqrt(231)/440)b_3^4` after the audited degree-six relation.
- Subtracting the two-atom shadow gives the exact identities
  `b_5 Delta_7=b_5/(sqrt(30)b_3) Delta_10+(13sqrt(42)/35)Delta_6^2` and
  `b_3 Delta_9=(sqrt(55)/50)Delta_12
  -(7sqrt(3)/50)(b_5/b_3)Delta_10
  -(1073sqrt(105)/31500)Delta_6^2`.
  The Jacobian in the free coordinates `(b_7^mu,b_9^mu)` is
  `(10sqrt(1650)/11)b_3^2 != 0`.
- Local markers passed:
  `R47_SHADOW_TWO_ATOM_RECURRENCE PASSED`,
  `R47_DEGREE10_FOCK_IDENTITY PASSED`,
  `R47_DEGREE12_FOCK_IDENTITY PASSED`,
  `R47_MISMATCH_COORDINATE_IDENTITIES PASSED`, and
  `R47_LOCAL_JACOBIAN_RANK2 PASSED`.
- This closes the finite algebraic “automatic rank collapse” possibility, but
  not the genuine all-degree problem.  The remaining OPEN is whether the two
  finite-prefix controls integrate simultaneously into all-degree positive
  full-exact laws with OU backward divisibility and the required weighted tail.
  Finite positive prefixes are not such laws; no no-go is claimed.

## R48 — heat-lift null hierarchy and moving-rank threshold (2026-09-06)

- The webpage completed the next round after reading the local framework,
  worklog, R36–R47 audit records, and exact nested-repository HEAD
  `27cf9753f898b2531728daf70607c9533c5424dd`.  It chose the all-degree
  obstruction route and used the rank-two shadow only to define a test
  polynomial, never imposing its null relation on the genuine full law.
- The new test is `P(x)=x^2-c*x-v`, with `v=1-a`, `c^2=2v`, and
  `r_k=L_a^mu(x^k P(x)^2)`.  The webpage identified the first defect slots:
  `r_3` sees `Delta_7` and `r_5` sees `Delta_9`.
- Added `flat_shadow_heatlift_rankescape_r48/audit_r48.py` and README.  The
  audit uses the variance-`v` generalized Hermite monomial expansion, which is
  essential for the `28v` and `36v` terms, and checks the exact rows
  `r_2` through `r_5`, the degree-eight same-factor identity, the flat block,
  the interior heat-lift formulas, the completed-square determinant, the root
  bracket for `f`, and OU scaling.
- Exact local output:
  `R48_NULL_DEFECT_HIERARCHY PASSED`;
  `R48_DEGREE8_BRANCH_IDENTITY PASSED`;
  `R48_SHIFTED_NULL_HANKEL_STRICTLY_INDEFINITE PASSED`;
  `R48_INTERIOR_HEAT_LIFT_FORMULAS PASSED`;
  `R48_COMPLETED_SQUARE_THRESHOLD_BRACKET PASSED`;
  `R48_XI1_SCALAR_THRESHOLD RECORDED`;
  `R48_OU_NULL_DEFECT_SCALING PASSED`;
  `R48_LIFTED_NULL_THRESHOLD_DIVERGENCE REMAINS OPEN`;
  `R48_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.
- The strict finite identity is
  `det [[r_2,r_3],[r_3,r_4]]
   =-(r_3+18*c*v^3)^2-648*v^7<0`.  This closes only the direct inverse-null
  positive-Christoffel route; it is not Gaussian-rigidity no-go and does not
  promote rank>=2 into a weighted no-go.
- The completed-square calculation gives the positive divisibility collar
  condition `(a-s)/v >= xi_*` whenever the relevant inverse law is positive,
  with `3/50<xi_*<1/16`.  This rules out near-flat endpoint approach as the
  source of rank escape, but it does not solve the original all-degree tail.
- The webpage's new smallest OPEN is the moving-rank threshold question
  `Xi_K -> infinity`, where `Xi_K` is the least `x=a/v` admitting the stated
  finite exact prefix and `Gamma_K>=0`.  Fixed `K` feasibility and
  all-degree positive full-exact realization remain strictly separate; `K=2`
  is the first lifted block seeing both odd defect slots.
- No optimizer, SDP, sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote computation was
  used.  Before the next web round, require reading the updated framework,
  worklog, and R36–R48 audit records and target `Xi_K` divergence or a rigorous
  obstruction to it.

## R49 — Christoffel compression and the moving-rank obstruction (2026-09-06)

- The webpage completed the R49 round after reading the local R48 framework,
  worklog, and audits, and verified nested-repository HEAD
  `23abb45b3671693c7fc408caaea7d777b2dcb1c9`.
- The new cubic test multiplier is
  `q(x)=x*(x^2-c*x-v)` with `c^2=2*v`.  If `Q_K` is the coefficient matrix
  of multiplication by `q`, the exact finite compression is
  `Gamma_K=Q_K^T H_(K+3) Q_K`.  Thus the lifted-null hierarchy is an ordinary
  Hamburger Gram compression, not an independent stronger positivity cone.
- With monic orthogonal polynomials `pi_n`, norms `h_n`, roots
  `zeta=(0,(c+sqrt(c^2+4v))/2,(c-sqrt(c^2+4v))/2)`, and
  `D_n=det[K_n(zeta_i,zeta_j)]` where `K_n` sums `pi_0,...,pi_n`, the exact
  Schur identity is
  `det(Gamma_K)/det(Gamma_(K-1))
   =h_(K+3)+p_(K+3)^T K_(K+2)^(-1)p_(K+3)`.
- The corresponding exact identities are
  `det(Gamma_K)=det(H_(K+3))*D_(K+3)/(6*v^3)` and
  `beta_tilde_K=beta_(K+3)*D_(K+3)*D_(K+1)/D_(K+2)^2`.
  The extra term is a nonnegative three-root interpolation leverage.  The
  webpage therefore correctly concludes that the lifted Gram block supplies
  no automatic sign pressure beyond ordinary Hankel positivity.
- Added `flat_shadow_christoffel_rankescape_r49/audit_r49.py` and README.  The
  audit checks the compression symbolically for generic moments and checks the
  Schur formula, determinant factorization, and transformed Jacobi recursion
  exactly for both standard Gaussian moments and a normalized positive
  five-point measure.  `py_compile` also passed.
- Local markers passed:
  `R49_CHRISTOFFEL_COMPRESSION_IDENTITY PASSED`,
  `R49_THREE_ROOT_SCHUR_FORMULA GAUSSIAN PASSED`,
  `R49_HANKEL_KERNEL_DETERMINANT_FACTORIZATION GAUSSIAN PASSED`,
  `R49_TRANSFORMED_JACOBI_RECURSION GAUSSIAN PASSED`,
  `R49_THREE_ROOT_SCHUR_FORMULA FIVE_POINT PASSED`,
  `R49_HANKEL_KERNEL_DETERMINANT_FACTORIZATION FIVE_POINT PASSED`,
  `R49_TRANSFORMED_JACOBI_RECURSION FIVE_POINT PASSED`,
  `R49_LIFTED_GRAM_NO_INDEPENDENT_SIGN_PRESSURE RECORDED`,
  `R49_ROOT_LEVERAGE_DOMINATED_EXIT REMAINS OPEN`, and
  `R49_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.
- Evidence boundary: all `Gamma_K>=0` would first produce a positive measure
  for `q^2*L_0`; inverse-Christoffel integrability and positivity of `L_0`
  remain separate.  No `Xi_K->infinity`, ordinary Jacobi exit, Gaussian
  rigidity, or transgression no-go is claimed.  `K=1` remains the audited
  scalar `xi_*` threshold, and `K=2` seeing `r_5/Delta_9` does not by itself
  create a new obstruction while the ordinary Hankel block is positive.
- The current smallest OPEN is the moving-rank quantitative tail: prove a
  uniform ordinary Jacobi exit, or the stronger root-leverage-dominated exit
  involving `Lambda_n`, for every compatible exact prefix at bounded
  `x=a/v`.  Before the next webpage round, require reading the updated
  framework, worklog, and R36–R49 README/audits.  No optimizer, SDP, sweep,
  relaxed measure-LP, or remote computation was used.

## R50 — two-step Jacobi center separation and tail budget (2026-09-06)

- The webpage completed R50 after reading the local framework, worklog, and
  R36–R49 audits, and verified nested-repository HEAD
  `3775204505b223767c71fb13a4b930be5e145875`.  It selected the ordinary-Jacobi
  route and did not claim that the new identities already prove an exit.
- For the current odd coordinate `y=m_(2n-1)`, the exact row
  `m_(2n)=E_n(y)` gives
  `h_n(y)=h_(n-1)B_n-(y-y_n^0)^2` and
  `S_(n-1)=(y-y_n^0)/h_(n-1)`, hence one-step viability is
  `|S_(n-1)|<sqrt(B_n)`.
- With
  `w_n(y)=(m_(n+1),...,m_(2n-2),y,m_(2n))^T` and
  `D_n(y)=E_(n+1)(y)-w_n(y)^T H_(n-1)^(-1)w_n(y)`, the free
  `m_(2n+1)` can cancel the two-step Schur off-diagonal.  Extension through
  the next block is then equivalent to `h_n(y)>0` and `D_n(y)>0`.
- The new exact curvature identity is
  `D_n''(y)=-2(H_(n-1)^(-1))_(n-2,n-2)
   =-2B_(n-1)/h_(n-1)<0`.  Completing the square in
  `s=S_(n-1)` gives
  `D_n(s)=M_n-B_(n-1)h_(n-1)(s-sigma_n)^2`, so the two-step question is an
  explicit overlap of the current viability interval with the next extension
  interval.
- Reusing the audited same-factor pressure, the exact odd derivative and even
  pivot are
  `partial_(m_(2n-1))G_(n+1)
   =-n(n+1)(n+5)(2/3)^(n+1)m_3` and
  `partial_(m_(2n+2))G_(n+1)=3(2/3)^(n+1)`.  Along the exact manifold the
  center shift is
  `Delta sigma_n^sf=n(n+1)(n+5)m_3/(6B_(n-1))`.
- Fixed `X` and the rank-2 head imply `v>=1/(1+X)` and
  `|m_3|>=sqrt(2)/(1+X)^(3/2)`, excluding the simplest head-amplitude-to-zero
  escape.  The proposed sufficient exit condition compares this pressure
  shift against `|sigma_n^geom|+sqrt(B_n)+R_n^+`, with
  `R_n^+=sqrt(M_n/(B_(n-1)h_(n-1)))`.  This is a precise target, not a proved
  estimate: R12 raw-moment bounds do not control moving inverse-Hankel spectra,
  `h_(n-1)^(-1)`, `B_n`, or root leverage.
- Added `flat_shadow_jacobi_center_separation_r50/audit_r50.py` and README.
  The local exact audit checks the pressure/pivot formulas for `n=2,...,6`, the
  two-step Schur identities and curvature for `n=3`, the center shift,
  completed-square algebra, and the fixed-`X` head lower bound.
- Local markers passed:
  `R50_SAME_FACTOR_PRESSURE_AND_EVEN_PIVOT PASSED`;
  `R50_ONE_STEP_VIABILITY_INTERVAL n=3 PASSED`;
  `R50_TWO_STEP_CURVATURE n=3 PASSED`;
  `R50_TWO_STEP_EXTENSION_CRITERION n=3 PASSED`;
  `R50_SAME_FACTOR_CENTER_SHIFT PASSED`;
  `R50_INTERVAL_OVERLAP_COMPLETION PASSED`;
  `R50_FIXED_X_HEAD_NONZERO PASSED`;
  `R50_FIXED_HEAD_TWO_STEP_EXIT REMAINS OPEN`;
  `R50_ROOT_LEVERAGE_DOMINATED_EXIT REMAINS OPEN`;
  `R50_FIXED_X_COMPACTNESS REMAINS CONDITIONAL`; and
  `R50_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  `py_compile` and `git diff --check` also passed.
- Evidence boundary remains strict: no ordinary-Jacobi exit, `Xi_K->infinity`,
  Gaussian rigidity, `P_3K` bridge, or global transgression is claimed.
  Fixed-`X` compactness is only the R25-derived conditional finite-intersection
  statement and does not supply a genuine positive inverse-Christoffel law or
  OU backward preimage.  The next webpage round must read R36–R50 and attack
  the `Fixed-Head Two-Step Jacobi Center-Separation / Tail-Budget Lemma` or
  construct a rigorously compatible bounded-`x` all-degree chain.  No optimizer,
  SDP, sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote computation was used.

## R51 — optimized two-step Jacobi budget (2026-09-06)

- The webpage first read the local framework, worklog, R36–R50 README/audits,
  and verified nested-repository HEAD `c04f58c4ec34138f6a1bec25b8e4983e775dd269`.
  It then refined the R50 target rather than repeating fixed-degree
  determinants.
- The new formal choice of the next odd moment cancels the two-step Schur
  off-diagonal and is equivalent to `S_n=0`.  With `widehat B_(n+1)` the
  doubly-centered next Jacobi budget, the exact identities are
  `D_n(0)/h_(n-1)=B_n*widehat B_(n+1)` and
  `D_n(s)/h_(n-1)=B_n*widehat B_(n+1)+2*B_(n-1)*sigma_n*s-B_(n-1)*s^2`.
- Completing the square gives
  `(R_n^+)^2=sigma_n^2+B_n*widehat B_(n+1)/B_(n-1)`.  Optimizing over
  `|s|<sqrt(B_n)` gives the exact value
  `V_n=B_n*widehat B_(n+1)+B_(n-1)*Psi_(sqrt(B_n))(sigma_n)`, with a
  nonnegative rescue term.  Strict two-step extension is equivalent to
  `V_n>0`, and exit to `V_n<=0`; if `widehat B_(n+1)>=0`, center pressure by
  itself cannot separate the two intervals.
- The geometric center is now explicitly
  `B_(n-1)*sigma_n=n*(n+1)*(n+5)*m_3/6-tr((J_n^circ)^3)/3`, and the generic
  tail identity is
  `tr(J_n(s)^3)=tr((J_n^circ)^3)+3*B_(n-1)*s`.  With
  `A_n=B_(n-1)*sigma_n`, the rescue term has the exact two-branch expression
  recorded in `flat_shadow_two_step_budget_r51/README.md`.
- The webpage's conditional theorem is algebraically valid: for fixed finite
  `X`, if some `4<=n<=N(X)` has
  `|A_n|<=kappa_X*B_(n-1)*sqrt(B_n)` and
  `widehat B_(n+1)<=-theta_X*B_(n-1)` with `theta_X>kappa_X^2`, then
  `V_n<0` and ordinary Jacobi exit occurs by `N(X)+1`.  Neither tail
  hypothesis is proved here; the current smallest one-lemma is uniform
  cubic-trace tracking plus centered-budget negativity.
- Added `flat_shadow_two_step_budget_r51/audit_r51.py` and README.  The local
  exact audit passed all five new markers, plus `py_compile` and
  `git diff --check`.  It records `R51_FIXED_HEAD_TWO_STEP_EXIT REMAINS OPEN`,
  `R51_ROOT_LEVERAGE_DOMINATED_EXIT REMAINS OPEN`, and
  `R51_XI_DIVERGENCE REMAINS OPEN`.
- Evidence boundary remains strict: no ordinary-Jacobi exit,
  `Xi_K->infinity`, Gaussian rigidity, `P_3K` bridge, or global transgression
  is claimed.  No optimizer, SDP, sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote
  computation was used.  Before the next webpage round, require reading the
  updated framework, worklog, and R36–R51 README/audits.

## R52 — global route audit and trace–budget obstruction (2026-09-06)

- The webpage first read `THEORY_ROUTE_FRAMEWORK.md`,
  `PROJECT_WORKLOG_APPEND.md`, R36–R51 README/audits, and verified nested
  repository HEAD `f7025279f3d625d5257e26319ed079a74e2bcb53`.  It then gave a
  global route audit before continuing the ordinary-Jacobi target.
- The global assessment is that R36–R51 completed three mechanism-level
  compressions: (i) one-body loss followed by a viable two-body
  Laguerre–Hoeffding carrier; (ii) finite-grade residue/rank separation up to
  corrected R46 and R47; and (iii) inverse-heat/Christoffel compression to an
  ordinary Hankel/Jacobi tail with an optimized two-step budget.  More fixed
  `m` determinants would now be local repetition; the remaining barrier is
  all-degree coherence.
- The three most mature self-contained theorem packages are R11–R13
  (exact-class tail/OU closure/tower rigidity), R36–R44 (two-body carrier and
  finite-grade constraint-coupled transgression), and R48–R51
  (inverse-heat/Christoffel to ordinary Jacobi plus two-step budget).  This is
  a mathematical self-containment assessment, not a checked novelty claim.
  Gaussian rigidity and the `P_3K` charge bridge remain open and logically
  distinct from fixed `m_3`, rank-two head, or Jacobi exit.
- R52 added the full-exact Jacobi walk identities
  `T_k-T_(k-1)=alpha_k^3+3*beta_k*(alpha_(k-1)+alpha_k)` and its
  `S_k,B_k` form, plus the two-control law
  `tr(J_n(s,t)^3)-tr((J_n^circ)^3)
   =3*B_(n-1)*s+t^3-3*s*t^2+3*B_n*t`.
- The centered-budget formulas are recorded with their variable distinction:
  displacement `s` in (A.7) completes as
  `B_n*B_(n+1)-B_(n-1)*(s-A_n/B_(n-1))^2+A_n^2/B_(n-1)`, while the actual
  chain coordinate `S_(n-1)` in (A.8) completes as
  `...+B_(n-1)*(S_(n-1)-A_n/B_(n-1))^2-A_n^2/B_(n-1)`.  They must not be
  conflated.  The sharp rescue function is
  `Phi(a)=a^2` for `a<=1` and `2*a-1` for `a>=1`, giving the optimal
  conditional threshold `theta>Phi(kappa)`.
- The structural obstruction is now explicit: cubic trace controls the
  linear/center channel, while centered budget is an independent constant
  channel.  Hence `Uniform Cubic-Trace Tracking + Centered-Budget Negativity`
  remains open; R12 raw tail bounds do not control the moving inverse-Hankel
  spectrum or Jacobi spikes.
- The recommended weaker milestone is `Canonical Centered-Tail Rigidity`:
  from a fixed R47-compatible bounded-`X` head, set each new odd coordinate
  `S_k=0` and solve exact `G_(k+1)=0`; prove finite occurrence of `B_k<=0`.
  If this fails with all `B_k>0`, Hamburger gives a genuine positive law with
  `E[Q^k]=2^k*k!` and eventually zero Jacobi diagonal, so the alternative is
  a strong infinite-chain candidate rather than a formal prefix.
- Added `flat_shadow_trace_budget_r52/audit_r52.py` and README.  Local exact
  markers passed:
  `R52_FULL_EXACT_JACOBI_TRACE_INCREMENT PASSED`,
  `R52_S_COORDINATE_TRACE_INCREMENT PASSED`,
  `R52_TWO_CONTROL_CUBIC_TRACE_LAW PASSED`,
  `R52_CENTERED_BUDGET_COMPLETE_SQUARE PASSED`,
  `R52_SHARP_RESCUE_CONE_AND_CONDITIONAL_EXIT PASSED`, followed by the four
  explicit OPEN markers and `R52_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.  `py_compile` passed.
- Evidence boundary remains strict: no ordinary-Jacobi exit, D.1,
  `Xi_K->infinity`, Gaussian rigidity, `P_3K` bridge, or global transgression
  is claimed.  Before the next webpage round, require reading the updated
  framework, worklog, and R36–R52 README/audits; prioritize D.1 and avoid
  determinants, optimizer, SDP, sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote
  computation.

## R53 — canonical centered tail and moving Gauss deficit (2026-09-06)

- The webpage completed READ_FIRST in the same Project conversation, verified
  nested-repository HEAD `abee8f94007648df2d349f9e3e856ae6ca307a1e`, and
  assessed R11–R13, R36–R44, and R48–R52 as three self-contained theorem
  packages at different levels.  R45–R47 are best treated as the bridge
  between the second and third packages.  This is a self-containment record,
  not a checked literature-novelty claim.
- R53 confirmed that canonical centered-tail rigidity is the correct next
  model problem but not the final equivalent theorem: fixing all new
  `S_k=0` removes arbitrary-control rescue directions.  Its failure would be
  much stronger than a finite-prefix failure because positive Jacobi norms
  would produce a genuine full-exact positive representing law.
- With `S_j=0` on the opened tail, the exact recurrence becomes
  `alpha_n=0`, `B_n=beta_n`,
  `pi_(n+1)=x*pi_n-B_n*pi_(n-1)`, and
  `h_n=h_K*product_(j=K+1)^n B_j`.  Canonical exit is the first `B_n<=0`
  while the preceding block is positive.
- The new quadrature identities are
  `m_(2n)-q_(2n)(n)=h_n` and
  `m_(2n+1)-q_(2n+1)(n)=(S_n+S_(n-1))*h_n`.  The second coefficient is
  `S_n+S_(n-1)`, not `alpha_n`, because the degree-`2n` error contributes
  `2*S_(n-1)*h_n`.  Hence canonical centering makes the next odd moment equal
  to the current n-point Gauss odd moment.
- Writing `delta_n` for the target chi-square cubic-product deficit, the
  full-exact row gives `delta_n=c_n*h_n`, `c_n=3*(2/3)^n`, and on the centered
  tail `B_n=beta_n=(3/2)*delta_n/delta_(n-1)`.  Thus D.1 is equivalent to a
  finite-stage sign change / overshoot question for a moving product Gauss
  quadrature.
- The obstruction is now narrower but genuine: eventual zero Jacobi diagonal
  need not make the original law symmetric because a finite Jacobi head can
  retain skewness; R12 raw tails do not control moving quadrature sign,
  nodes, weights, or inverse-Hankel conditioning.  A weaker sufficient target
  is `mu in E and alpha_n=0 eventually => m_3(mu)=0`.  Gaussian rigidity and
  the `P_3K` bridge remain separate OPEN problems.
- Added `flat_shadow_canonical_tail_r53/audit_r53.py` and README.  The local
  audit checks the canonical Jacobi recurrence, even/odd Gauss error formulas,
  deficit/norm ratio, cubic-trace stabilization, and finite Favard positivity.
  It passed the exact markers and explicitly leaves canonical rigidity and
  eventual skew annihilation OPEN.  The realization marker is conditional on
  all future `beta_n>0`; it is not a positivity proof.
- No determinant, optimizer, SDP, sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote
  computation was used.  Before R54, read the updated framework, worklog, and
  R36–R53 README/audit; the next target is eventual-skew annihilation or a
  genuine moving-quadrature sign theorem, not another fixed-degree expansion.

## R55 — finite skew head versus eventual zero tail (2026-09-06)

- The webpage continued in the same Project conversation after the R53
  canonical-tail round.  It found no genuine full-exact non-Gaussian
  counterexample, but gave the exact control family
  `alpha=[0,a,-a,0,...]`, `beta_n=1`, with
  `m_1=0`, `m_2=1`, `m_3=a`, and `m_4=2+a^2`.  At `a=1/2`, `m_4=9/4 != 3`,
  so this family fails the second full-exact row and is only an obstruction to
  the implication “eventual zero Jacobi diagonal implies symmetry”.
- The associated-tail resolvent relation
  `m_k(z)=1/(z-alpha_k-beta_(k+1)m_(k+1)(z))` shows that a finite positive
  Jacobi head is a nonconstant Mobius transform of the tail m-function.
  Hence a symmetric eventual tail does not erase finite-head skew; full exact
  coherence would have to supply the missing cancellation.
- R55 proposed a factorial-growth obstruction, but its displayed
  `limsup log(n!/h_n)/n=+infinity` is not equivalent to failure of
  `h_n<=C*A^n*n!`.  The correct root-test form is
  `limsup (h_n/n!)^(1/n)=infinity`, equivalently
  `liminf log(n!/h_n)/n=-infinity`, for envelope failure.  The stronger
  skew-forced statement remains an OPEN lemma and must not be recorded as a
  consequence of the R12 upper envelope alone.
- Added `flat_shadow_skew_forced_escape_r55/audit_r55.py` and README.  The
  local audit passed the finite-head moment identities, nonconstant Mobius
  coupling, corrected factorial-envelope logic, and conditional positive
  deficit sign.  It records
  `R55_SKEW_FORCED_FACTORIAL_ESCAPE REMAINS OPEN`,
  `R55_EVENTUAL_DIAGONAL_SKEW_ANNIHILATION REMAINS OPEN`, and the D.1/P3K
  implications without claiming them proved.
- No determinant, optimizer, SDP, sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote
  computation was used.  Before R56, read the updated framework, worklog, and
  R36–R55 README/audits.  The next target is the corrected
  `R56 — Skew-Forced Factorial Escape Lemma`, including a search for the
  weakest additional tail-transfer hypothesis if the unconditional statement
  fails.

## R56 — factorial-escape gap recorded, not closed (2026-09-06)

- R56 was sent in the same Project conversation and returned a substantive
  response, but it did not prove or refute the skew-forced factorial escape
  lemma.  It correctly located the missing bridge between all-degree exact
  recurrence and the R12 upper norm envelope; no lower-growth or sign
  mechanism was obtained.
- The webpage response repeated an invalid “or equivalently” after the
  expression `limsup (1/n) log(n!/h_n)=+infinity`.  This was corrected locally:
  `h_n<=C*A^n*n!` is equivalent to
  `limsup (h_n/n!)^(1/n)<infinity`; envelope failure is equivalent to
  `limsup log(h_n/n!)/n=+infinity`, or reversed-log `liminf=-infinity`.
  The explicit sequence `h_n=n!/2^(n^2)` proves that the reversed-log
  `limsup=+infinity` can coexist with a valid envelope.
- The exact canonical constants remain
  `delta_n=c_n*h_n`, `c_n=3*(2/3)^n`, and
  `beta_n=(3/2)*delta_n/delta_(n-1)` under the positive-chain premise.  This
  gives conditional deficit positivity, not a proof of future positivity.
- Added `flat_shadow_skew_forced_escape_r56/audit_r56.py` and README.  The
  local audit passed both growth-logic checks and the canonical constants.  It
  records `R56_SKEW_FORCED_FACTORIAL_ESCAPE REMAINS OPEN`,
  `R56_EVENTUAL_DIAGONAL_SKEW_ANNIHILATION REMAINS OPEN`, and keeps D.1,
  Gaussian rigidity, and the P3K bridge distinct.
- No determinant, optimizer, SDP, sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote
  computation was used.  Before R57, read the updated framework, worklog, and
  R36–R56 README/audits.  The next target is one concrete all-degree invariant,
  a genuine full-exact positive counterexample, or a weakest tail-transfer
  condition supplied by backward-OU positivity.

## R57 — canonical viability replaces factorial escape (2026-09-06)

- R57 was sent and completed in the same Project conversation.  It corrected
  the R56 growth route in a stronger way: on any positive canonical exact
  prefix, `Q_n>=0` gives `0<delta_n<=2^n*n!`; with
  `delta_n=3*(2/3)^n*h_n`, this implies
  `0<h_n<=3^(n-1)*n!`.  Thus all-positive viability automatically satisfies
  the factorial envelope, so nonzero `m_3` cannot force growth escape.
- The real global dichotomy is now finite sign exit
  (`delta_n<=0`, equivalently `beta_n<=0`) versus an infinite positive exact
  chain.  The latter would be promoted by the R53 Favard/Hamburger mechanism
  to a genuine full-exact positive law; it is not a finite-prefix artifact.
- R57 supplied a finite-stage canonical skew family with `a=m_3`,
  `alpha_2=-a`, `alpha_n=0` for `n>=3`, and
  `m_4=3`, `m_5=4a`, `m_6=15+7a^2`, `m_7=15a`,
  `m_8=105+4a^2`,
  `m_9=a*(96-112a^2-49a^4)/(2-a^2)`,
  `m_10=945-234a^2`.  Local recurrence recomputation fixes
  `beta_2=2-a^2`, `beta_3=6*(1+a^2)/(2-a^2)` and verifies all computed
  `beta_2,...,beta_5` are positive at `a=1/10`; this is finite-stage only.
- A separate exact conditional result from backward-OU positivity is
  `h_n(mu)>=(1-lambda)^n*n!` for `mu=P_lambda nu`, hence from `G_2=0`,
  `m_3^2<=2*lambda*(2-lambda)`.  Arbitrarily deep positive OU divisibility
  forces `m_3=0`; this remains distinct from the single eventual-zero
  diagonal problem and from Gaussian rigidity/P3K.
- Added `flat_shadow_canonical_viability_r57/audit_r57.py` and README.  The
  local audit is intended to pass the finite moments, beta orientation,
  finite-stage positivity, positive-branch upper envelope, and OU inequality;
  it explicitly leaves finite sign exit, infinite positive viability, D.1,
  eventual skew annihilation, Gaussian rigidity, and P3K OPEN.
- No determinant, optimizer, SDP, sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote
  computation was used.  Before R58, read the updated framework, worklog, and
  R36–R57 README/audits.  The next target is the moving-deficit zero-set on
  the surviving skew interval, not another factorial-growth argument.

## R58 — OU/Jacobi bridge boundary (2026-09-06)

- R58 was sent to the same Project conversation to test whether the R53
  Favard/Hamburger spectral law automatically inherits the original positive
  backward-OU tower.  The webpage distinguished the objects but stalled before
  giving a transfer map; it was safely stopped.  No bridge theorem is claimed.
- The audit records the exact conditional implication: if the bridge supplied
  `mu_*=P_{q^N}nu_N` for every `N`, then
  `h_2(mu_*)>=2(1-q^N)^2` and the exact `h_2=2-m_3^2` row would give
  `m_3^2<=2q^N(2-q^N)`, hence `m_3=0` as `N->infinity`.
- The missing data are law identification (or an explicit map), normalization
  preservation, moment/Jacobi-variable preservation, and OU intertwining.
  Positivity of an abstract Hankel functional is not enough to transfer the
  density-level equation `g^(j)=P_q g^(j+1)`.
- Added `flat_shadow_ou_jacobi_bridge_r58/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_ou_jacobi_bridge_r58/audit_r58.py`.  The local audit checks the
  conditional algebra and limit, and prints the bridge as OPEN.  No determinant,
  optimizer, SDP, sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote computation was used.
- R58 does not close D.1, infinite positive viability, Gaussian rigidity, or
  the `P_3 K` bridge.  Next R59 must either prove an explicit OU–Favard transfer
  lemma or state the exact missing hypothesis and perform one concrete
  corrected-orientation `beta_6/beta_7` recurrence.

## R59 — canonical beta6 positivity contraction (2026-09-06)

- R59 completed in the same Project conversation.  It selected the precise
  negative bridge result: Favard/Hamburger positivity reconstructs an auxiliary
  Jacobi spectral law and does not transfer the original density-level OU tower.
  The minimum missing data are law identification or an explicit map,
  normalization preservation, moment/monic-norm preservation, and OU
  intertwining.  Conditional on `mu_*=P_{q^N}nu_N`, the exact degree-two bound
  still yields `m_3^2<=2q^N(2-q^N)` and hence `m_3=0` as `N` tends to infinity.
- The webpage supplied the degree-12 continuation of the canonical family:
  `m_11=a(140t^2-913t-30)/(2-t)` and
  `m_12=(2849t^3-19102t^2-15987t+20790)/(2-t)`, with
  `P_6(t)=532t^6-45655t^5+351508t^4-625952t^3+
  110432t^2+83200t-7680`.
- Independent local recurrence recomputation corrected the browser's recurring
  flattened-fraction inversion.  The verified norms are
  `h_5=3p_5/[2(2-t)(1+t)]`, `h_6=-6P_6/[(2-t)^2p_4]`, and the project
  convention `beta_6=h_6/h_5` gives
  `beta_6=-4(1+t)P_6/[(2-t)p_4p_5]`.  The sign is `-sign(P_6)` on the prior
  positive interval, so strict monotonicity of `P_6` and its exact signs at
  `1/20` and `1/10` produce a unique `tau_6 in (1/20,1/10)` and shrink the
  nonzero-skew prefix window to `0<t<tau_6`.
- Added `flat_shadow_canonical_beta6_r59/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_canonical_beta6_r59/audit_r59.py`.  The audit passed the
  degree-12 same-factor row, direct `h_6/h_5` orientation, `P_6` monotonicity,
  and exact sign bracket.  No determinant, optimizer, SDP, sweep,
  relaxed measure-LP, or remote computation was used.
- R59 does not close D.1, infinite positive viability, eventual skew
  annihilation, Gaussian rigidity, or the `P_3 K` bridge.  The next unique
  lemma is `beta_7` positivity-interval contraction on `0<t<tau_6`.

## R60 — beta7 remains positive on the beta6 window (2026-09-06)

- R60 completed in the same Project conversation.  Its reliable conclusion is
  alternative (2): `beta_7>0` throughout `0<t<tau_6`; there is no
  `tau_7<tau_6`.  This is a useful alternating phenomenon: beta6 creates a
  cutoff, while beta7 preserves the entire reduced interval.
- Independent local recomputation used `alpha_6=0` and the degree-14
  same-factor relation.  It verified
  `m_13=3a(1145t^2-2284t-2280)/(2-t)` and
  `m_14=(839909t^3-1338415t^2-187437t+270270)/(2-t)`, correcting the
  browser's different reduced `m_14` polynomial.
- With `P_7=2150400+19281920t-206264064t^2-424134656t^3+
  2523473440t^4-4074599496t^5+2790646820t^6-853051174t^7+
  100963863t^8-2264192t^9`, the corrected factor structure is
  `h_7=3P_7/[(2-t)^3p_5]` and
  `beta_7=h_7/h_6=-p_4P_7/[2(2-t)p_5P_6]`.  At `t=0`, this gives
  `h_6=720,h_7=5040,beta_7=7`.
- The local audit proves `P_7>0` on `[0,1/10]` by exact positive Bernstein
  coefficients, and checks the degree-14 relation plus exact rational family
  points for the high-degree norm factor.  Added
  `flat_shadow_canonical_beta7_r60/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_canonical_beta7_r60/audit_r60.py`; audit, py_compile and
  `git diff --check` passed.
- R60 leaves D.1, infinite positive viability, eventual skew annihilation,
  Gaussian rigidity and the `P_3 K` bridge OPEN.  The next unique target is
  corrected degree-16 `beta_8` sign/positivity on `0<t<tau_6`.

## R61 — corrected beta8 cutoff (2026-09-06)

- R61 completed in the same Project conversation and qualitatively found a new
  degree-16 cutoff.  The webpage's high-degree `m16`, `P8`, and norm fractions
  failed independent local recurrence/Gaussian checks, so they were not
  adopted verbatim.
- The corrected continuation is
  `m15=a(42287t^5-330144t^4+228921t^3+556826t^2+306060t-531720)/(2-t)^3`
  and
  `m16=3(12981388t^3-26820320t^2-837195t+1351350)/(2-t)`.
  With the corrected degree-12 `P8`,
  `h8=-3P8/[2(2-t)^3P6]` and
  `beta8=h8/h7=-p5*P8/(2*P6*P7)`, giving the Gaussian check
  `h7=5040,h8=40320,beta8=8` at `t=0`.
- Exact Bernstein certificates show `P8' < 0` on `[0,1/25]` and
  `P8 < 0` on `[1/25,9/100]`; since `P8(0)>0` and `P8(1/25)<0`, there is a
  unique `tau8 in (0,1/25)`.  R59's strict `P6` monotonicity plus
  `P6(9/100)>0` puts `tau6<9/100`, so `beta8>0` iff `0<t<tau8` within the
  prior window and `beta8<0` on `tau8<t<tau6`.
- Added `flat_shadow_canonical_beta8_r61/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_canonical_beta8_r61/audit_r61.py`.  The audit passed exact
  rational degree-16 row/norm checks, Gaussian orientation, and both Bernstein
  sign certificates; py_compile and `git diff --check` passed.  The result is
  committed as `6be35de`.
- R61 establishes the partial even-cutoff pattern `tau6>tau8>0`, with beta7
  positive between them, but does not close D.1, infinite positive viability,
  eventual skew annihilation, Gaussian rigidity, or the `P_3 K` bridge.  Next
  unique target: corrected degree-18 `beta9` sign lemma on `0<t<tau8`.

## R62 — corrected beta9 cutoff (2026-09-06)

- The local degree-18 continuation was independently derived before accepting
  any high-order webpage fraction.  With `a=m3`, `t=a^2`, and the canonical
  zero diagonal from level 3 onward, `alpha8=0` gives
  `m17=2a(5799325t^5-17049855t^4+3925920t^3+13603108t^2+
  3127296t-4435200)/(2-t)^3`.  The degree-18 same-factor row gives
  `m18=(2948477t^6+1914655626t^5-11976383460t^4+24318362039t^3-
  15915490026t^2-432574380t+275675400)/(2-t)^3`.
- The corrected norm factor is `h9=3Q9/[(2-t)^4 P7]`, where `Q9` is the
  exact degree-16 polynomial recorded in
  `flat_shadow_canonical_beta9_r62/README.md`.  Together with
  `h8=-3P8/[2(2-t)^3 P6]`, the project orientation gives
  `beta9=h9/h8=-2P6 Q9/[(2-t)P7 P8]`.  At `t=0`,
  `(h8,h9,beta9)=(40320,362880,9)`, so the direction is fixed.
- Exact Bernstein certificates show `Q9>0` on `[0,1/100]` and
  `Q9'<0` on `[1/100,1/25]`.  Exact endpoint signs give
  `Q9(1/100)>0`, `Q9(19/500)<0`, while the R61 certificate plus
  `P8(19/500)>0>P8(1/25)` gives `tau8>19/500`.  Hence a unique
  `tau9 in (1/100,19/500)` satisfies `Q9(tau9)=0`, and
  `tau9<tau8`; numerically `tau9≈0.0379679226232613` only as orientation.
- On `0<t<tau8`, prior signs give `P6<0`, `P7>0`, `P8>0`, so
  `beta9>0` exactly on `0<t<tau9` and `beta9<0` on `tau9<t<tau8`.
  This is a second consecutive even-stage contraction after R61, with the
  partial pattern `tau6>tau8>tau9>0` and beta7 positive between the first
  two cutoffs.
- Added `flat_shadow_canonical_beta9_r62/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_canonical_beta9_r62/audit_r62.py`.  The audit passed the exact
  degree-18 row and norm checks, Gaussian orientation, Bernstein sign
  certificates, and the cutoff comparison.  D.1, infinite positive
  viability, eventual skew annihilation, Gaussian rigidity, and the `P_3 K`
  bridge remain open.  No determinant, optimizer, SDP, sweep, relaxed
  measure-LP, or remote computation was used.  The next unique target is a
  structural all-even-stage contraction lemma, not another unverified large
  formula.

- Webpage R62 review: the qualitative cutoff conclusion agrees with the local
  audit, including `tau9<tau8`, but the displayed formulas for `h8` and `h9`
  were each reciprocated.  Consequently its displayed `beta9` fraction was
  also the reciprocal of the project convention, despite the prose and the
  Gaussian values claiming `h8=40320`, `h9=362880`, `beta9=9`.  The local
  formulas in `flat_shadow_canonical_beta9_r62/README.md` remain authoritative;
  this is a recorded webpage transcription error, not a change to R62.

## R63 — corrected degree-20 beta10 cutoff (2026-09-06)

- The degree-20 same-factor row was solved linearly and exactly for `m20`,
  correcting the earlier exploratory truncated-series expression.  Together
  with `alpha9=0`, the exact row checks pass at `a=0,1/10,1/5`.
- The exact norm has the factorization `h10=A10/[(t-2)^5 P8]`, with the full
  degree-20 `A10` recorded in `flat_shadow_canonical_beta10_r63/README.md`.
  Hence `beta10=A10 P7/[3(t-2)P8 Q9]` and the Gaussian check is
  `(m20,h10,beta10)=(19!!,10!,10)` at `t=0`; the local derivative is
  `beta10'(0)=-1481/21`.
- Exact Bernstein certificates prove `A10' > 0` on `[0,1/200]`,
  `A10(0)<0<A10(1/200)`, `A10>0` on `[1/200,19/500]`, and the norm
  denominator is negative on `[0,19/500]`.  Therefore a unique
  `tau10 in (0,1/200)` exists, and because R62 gives
  `tau9 in (1/100,19/500)`, `beta10>0` on `0<t<tau10` and
  `beta10<0` on `tau10<t<tau9`.
- R63 therefore establishes the finite-stage chain
  `tau6>tau8>tau9>tau10>0`.  It still does not prove D.1, eventual skew
  annihilation, Gaussian rigidity, or the `P_3 K` bridge.  The next target is
  structural: explain the decreasing cutoffs without another unverified large
  expansion.
- Added `flat_shadow_canonical_beta10_r63/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_canonical_beta10_r63/audit_r63.py`.  The full audit passed,
  including exact row checks, norm factorization, Gaussian orientation, and
  Bernstein sign certificates; no determinant, optimizer, SDP, sweep,
  relaxed measure-LP, or remote computation was used.

## R64 — structural quadratic-response audit (2026-09-06)

- The webpage supplied a candidate all-degree structural reduction rather than
  another high-degree coefficient list.  Under the full same-factor hierarchy,
  the canonical Jacobi head has first variation
  `J_a=J_0+a(|e1><e1|-|e2><e2|)+O(a^2)`.  Duhamel expansion gives the exact
  odd Hermite tangent
  `[a]L_a[H_(2m+1)]=(-1)^(m-1)m(m+1)!/2`.
- The formal same-factor generating identity gives a universal second-order
  even convolution in terms of the exact three-angle sums `A_(2n)` and
  `C_(r,s)`.  Exact root-of-unity evaluation agrees with the canonical moments
  for every even degree `4,6,...,20`.
- Monic orthogonality gives the norm-curvature formula
  `K_n=L2[H_n^2]-sum_{k<n}L1[H_nH_k]^2/k!` and
  `beta_n'(0)=(K_n-nK_(n-1))/(n-1)!`.  It passes through `n=10`, including
  R63's `beta10'(0)=-1481/21`.
- This is recorded as a conditional all-degree response lemma: it explains
  the common mechanism behind the finite cutoffs but does not prove a uniform
  `O(t^2)` remainder, `tau_(2k+2)<tau_(2k)` for all `k`, D.1, or the OU/Favard
  bridge.  The next target is a uniform asymptotic/sign estimate for this
  quadratic response, or a finite-`t` tail deficit if Gaussian-local curvature
  is insufficient.
- Added `flat_shadow_structural_response_r64/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_structural_response_r64/audit_r64.py`.  The exact audit passed
  odd tangent checks through degree 19, even convolution checks through degree
  20, and norm-slope checks through `n=10`; py_compile and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## R65 — finite quadratic sums and local-slope correction (2026-09-06)

- The webpage's root-of-unity reduction was independently checked and recorded
  as the exact finite formula
  `C_(r,s)=3(3E_(r,s)-binom(2n,n))/(2*6^n)`, with `E_(r,s)` the mod-3 selected
  binomial sum.  The induced `v_(2n)`, `M_(n,k)`, `D_n`, `K_n`, and
  `Lambda_n` formulas are now in `flat_shadow_quadratic_response_r65/README.md`.
- Targeted exact arithmetic reproduces the audited slopes at `n=10,15,20,30`
  and gives `Lambda_100>0`, `Lambda_200>0`.  Eventual sign and asymptotic
  scale remain OPEN; no finite table is promoted to a theorem.
- The webpage's conditional local-slope cutoff lemma contained a decisive
  reciprocal error.  From `beta_n=n+Lambda_n t+R_n` and
  `|R_n|<=eta|Lambda_n|t`, the correct linear zero scale is
  `T_n=n/((1-eta)|Lambda_n|)`, with first-zero bounds
  `n/((1+eta)|Lambda_n|)<=tau_n<=n/((1-eta)|Lambda_n|)`.  Thus cutoff shrinkage
  would require `|Lambda_n|/n -> infinity` plus a uniform remainder radius;
  the opposite condition stated on the webpage is invalid and is explicitly
  excluded from the local record.
- Added `flat_shadow_quadratic_response_r65/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_quadratic_response_r65/audit_r65.py`.  The exact targeted audit,
  py_compile, and `git diff --check` passed.  The next target is a rigorous
  generating-function or finite-`t` tail analysis, not another local-slope
  extrapolation.

## R66 — Mehler decomposition and projection-tail reduction (2026-09-06)

- Webpage R66 accepted the R65 reciprocal-scale correction. The correct local
  zero scale remains `n/|Lambda_n|`; no asymptotic sign or `n^(-1/2)` law was
  promoted.
- The quadratic response was split as `K(z)=D(z)-P(z)`, with
  `D(z)=sum D_n z^n/n!` and `P(z)=sum P_n z^n/n!`.
- The exact D-part binomial transform is
  `D(z)=1/(1-z) sum_m (v_(2m)/m!) (z/(1-z))^m`. The same-factor hierarchy
  converts it to
  `D(z)=-1/(3z) integral exp(-(1-z)u/z) B(sqrt(6u)) du`.
- The finite-head tangent gives the associated-Hermite recurrence
  `q_0=q_1=0`, `q_2=-H_1`, `q_3=-H_0`,
  `q_(n+1)=xq_n-nq_(n-1)` for `n>=3`; hence
  `P_n=||q_n||_gamma^2`.
- The EGF `Q`, Gaussian two-variable kernel `R`, angular diagonal extraction,
  and factorial Laplace transform were independently checked. In particular,
  `H(y)=sum ||q_n||^2 y^n/(n!)^2` and
  `P(z)=sum ||q_n||^2 z^n/n!`; the explicit Gaussian-shift polynomial has the
  factor `st/4`.
- The endpoint expansion gives `U(w)=w^3/6+O(w^5)` at zero and
  `U(w)=-4/w^3+O(w^(-5))` at positive infinity. Under the corresponding
  angular zero-neighborhood estimate, `B(w)=O(w^(-4))`, so D has no pole at
  `z=1`; the only unresolved singularity is the associated-Hermite norm tail.
- Added `flat_shadow_mehler_projection_r66/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_mehler_projection_r66/audit_r66.py`. The exact audit is the
  authoritative local record; it does not use determinant, optimizer, SDP,
  sweep, relaxed measure-LP, or remote computation.

## R67 — associated-Hermite projection square-root law (2026-09-07)

- Webpage R67 derived the exact representation
  q_n=-A_(n-3)^(3)+3xA_(n-4)^(4), with associated-Hermite recurrence
  A_(m+1)^(c)=xA_m^(c)-(m+c)A_(m-1)^(c).
- Combining the ordinary Hermite expansions yields a positive finite sum for
  p_n=||q_n||_gamma^2/n!, with coefficients
  c_(m,j)=(-1)^(j+1)((j+1)(j+2)(j^2+5j-2m)/2)
  ((m-j-1)!/(m-2j)!), m=n-3.
- The exact factorial ratio has the Gaussian scaling
  rho_(m,j)=m^5(m-j-1)!^2/((m-2j)!(m+3)!), and the Riemann limit is
  integral (1/4)y^4(y^2-2)^2 exp(-y^2)dy=33 sqrt(pi)/128. Hence
  p_n~(33 sqrt(pi)/128)n^(-1/2).
- Consequently P(z)~(33 pi/128)(1-z)^(-1/2) radially at z=1, while
  K(z)=D(z)-P(z) has the opposite singular part under the R66 D-boundary
  hypothesis. This is a reportable Gaussian-local projection result.
- Full coefficientwise Lambda_n asymptotics remain OPEN because the D-part
  needs a coefficient-level transfer and first-difference bound. No finite
  samples were promoted to an eventual-sign theorem.
- Added `flat_shadow_associated_hermite_r67/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_associated_hermite_r67/audit_r67.py`. The exact audit
  passed; it does not use beta_11/degree22, determinant, optimizer, SDP, sweep,
  relaxed measure-LP, or remote computation.

## R68 — D-part coefficient transfer (2026-09-07)

- The webpage expanded the R66 Laplace representation into an exact parameter
  rational kernel on the slit domain
  `C\([1,infinity) union (-infinity,-2])`, together with an exact coefficient
  formula for `d_n=D_n/n!`.
- It used the D3 identity `r_0+r_1+r_2=0` to cancel the leading contribution
  in simple-zero neighborhoods and claimed the sectorial strengthening
  `B(w)=O(|w|^(-5))`. With the stated complex-sector contour hypotheses, this
  gives the coefficient-level bounds `d_n=O(n^(-5/2))` and
  `n(d_n-d_(n-1))=O(n^(-3/2))`.
- The local record deliberately distinguishes the exact algebra from the
  analytic hypothesis needed for contour rotation; finite Abel convergence is
  not used as a substitute for coefficient transfer.
- Added `flat_shadow_dpart_transfer_r68/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_dpart_transfer_r68/audit_r68.py`. The exact audit passed;
  `py_compile` and `git diff --check` are the next repository checks.
- R68 removes the D-part as the leading asymptotic obstruction under its
  transfer hypotheses. The only remaining Gaussian-local target is the
  associated-Hermite first difference
  `p_(n-1)-p_n~(33 sqrt(pi)/256)n^(-3/2)`; full `Lambda_n` eventual sign and
  D.1 remain OPEN.

## R69 — Projection first-difference asymptotic (2026-09-07)

- The webpage directly compared adjacent summands in the R67 positive finite
  sum. With `m=n-3`, the exact ratio is
  `L_(m,j)=(m+3)(m-2j)/(m-j-1)^2`, and
  `L_(m,j)-1=(5m-j^2-8j-1)/(m-j-1)^2`.
- After scaling `G_(m,j)=m^2(T_(m-1,j)-T_(m,j))` and using the R67
  factorial-ratio majorant, the common `j~sqrt(m)` limit is
  `G(y)=(1/4)(-y^10+9y^8-20y^6+12y^4)exp(-y^2)`. The floor endpoint is
  exponentially negligible, and exact Gaussian moments give
  `integral G=33 sqrt(pi)/256`.
- Thus the projection difference theorem is now established in the conditional
  R64–R68 framework:
  `p_(n-1)-p_n~(33 sqrt(pi)/256)n^(-3/2)`.
- Combining this with R68's D-part transfer yields
  `Lambda_n~(33 sqrt(pi)/256)n^(-1/2)>0` and closes the Gaussian-local
  eventual-sign question under the stated hypotheses. It rules out the
  large-n negative-slope shrinking-cutoff mechanism but does not prove D.1.
- Added `flat_shadow_projection_difference_r69/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_projection_difference_r69/audit_r69.py`. The exact audit passed;
  the next target is finite-t nonlinear/boundary-layer behavior.

## R70 — Finite-t boundary-layer necessity (2026-09-07)

- Webpage R70 supplied a scale-free necessary lemma for the remaining finite-t
  mechanism. For `beta_hat_n=beta_n/n=1+ell_n t+N_n(t)`, any zero `tau_n` obeys
  `N_n(tau_n)=-1-ell_n tau_n` and therefore the absolute nonlinear Taylor tail
  has mass at least `1+ell_n tau_n` on that scale.
- The C2 version gives the sharper curvature requirement
  `tau_n^2 M_n(tau_n)>=2(1+ell_n tau_n)`, so a shrinking zero needs curvature of
  order `tau_n^(-2)` (or `n*tau_n^(-2)` before normalization). A uniform Cauchy
  radius/bound instead yields a geometric tail bound and rules out zeros when
  the tested scale is `o(R_n)`.
- This is a necessary/no-go result, not a construction of a reversal and not a
  proof of D.1 or of the positive backward tower. The remaining target is now
  sharply narrowed to an all-order nonlinear-tail scaling profile or an all-order
  tail majorant.
- Added `flat_shadow_boundary_layer_r70/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_boundary_layer_r70/audit_r70.py`. The exact audit, `py_compile`,
  and `git diff --check` passed after correcting the audit's symbol-substitution
  check. The next webpage target is R71: derive a profile `N_n(s_n x)` or prove
  a uniform `o(1)` tail bound.

## R71 — Hermite–Gram all-order boundary-layer barrier (2026-09-07)

- The webpage explicitly reported that its connector could not read the R70
  local records. I therefore treated its output as a proposal and re-derived
  the admitted identities against the local R64/R70 framework before recording.
- The new conditional lemma lifts the scalar boundary-layer necessity to the
  finite Hermite Gram block `G_n(a)=(L_a[e_j e_k])`, with `e_k=H_k/sqrt(k!)`.
  The first tangent is represented by a bounded Gaussian multiplier `g_1`, so
  `sup_n ||A_n||_op<infinity` in `G_n=I+aA_n+R_n`.
- If a prior-positive norm chain has a shrinking first exit, the normalized Gram
  block is singular while `sqrt(tau_n)A_n=o(1)`. Hence the nonlinear Gram tail
  must satisfy `||R_n(sqrt(tau_n))||_op>=1-o(1)`. This is a genuine operator-level
  barrier and does not construct a reversal.
- Hermite product expansion gives the exact finite reduction
  `R_n(a)=sum_(m<=2n)r_m(a)T_(m,n)` and the explicit conditional majorant
  `M_n(a)=3^(n/2)sum_(m<=2n)3^(m/2)|r_m(a)|`. A bound for this quantity on an
  explicit `a_n` scale would immediately produce a no-reversal result on
  `t<=a_n^2`; no such all-`n` source bound is yet available.
- The exact angular eigenvalue is `A_(2k)=3 binom(2k,k)/6^k`, decreasing by the
  ratio `(2k+1)/(3(k+1))`; the inverse solver scale is asymptotic to
  `sqrt(pi*n)/3*(3/2)^n`. This is only a locator for possible amplification, not
  an existence or cutoff theorem.
- Added `flat_shadow_gram_barrier_r71/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_gram_barrier_r71/audit_r71.py`. The audit passed the normalization,
  Gaussian-transform, endpoint-bound, Schur-kernel, all-order-majorant, and
  angular-eigenvalue checks; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` remain to be run.
- R71 does not close D.1, positive exact backward-tower existence, or backward
  OU divisibility. The next unique target is a same-factor nonlinear-source
  Banach majorant for `M_n(a)`, or a rigorously derived operator profile near the
  angular-solver scale.

## R72 — Analytic-norm angular tameness and conditional odd-solver closure (2026-09-07)

- The webpage again reported that its connector could not read the R71 local
  files. I used its new formulas only as a proposal and checked them against the
  local R71 normalization. The exact angular eigenvalue is
  `A_(2k)=3*binom(2k,k)/6^k` with `q=sqrt(2/3)`.
- In the truncated analytic Wiener norm, the even source equation is exact:
  `f_e=-A_e^(-1)[Q(f,f)+C(f,f,f)]`, with source bounds
  `||Q||_R<=3||f||_(qR)^2` and `||C||_R<=||f||_(qR)^3`. A fixed radius loss gives
  `||A_e^(-1)||<=C_A(theta)` and `C_A(1/2)=1/6`; the coefficientwise exponential
  inverse scale is cancelled by the `q` radius factor.
- With the explicit but unproved odd-solver tame hypothesis
  `||O_n(a,e)||_(8sqrt(n))<=Omega_n(|a|^3+|a| ||e||_(4sqrt(n)))`, the even
  bootstrap closes and yields
  `Mcal_n(a)<=4*C_B*3^(n/2)*a^2*U_n^2` with
  `C_B=1/(1-sqrt(6)/4)`. The explicit conditional scale `a_n#` in the local
  record then gives `Mcal_n<=1/n` and an all-degree no-reversal interval
  `t<=a_n#^2`.
- This is not an unconditional scale: `Omega_n`, its domain, and repeated odd
  source accumulation are still unproved. The unique next target is the
  canonical odd-solver Banach estimate with explicit `n` growth, or a rigorous
  proof of its failure at a specific scale.
- Added `flat_shadow_odd_solver_majorant_r72/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_odd_solver_majorant_r72/audit_r72.py`. The exact audit passed
  angular scaling/Wallis, Wiener source constants, bootstrap constants, Gram
  majorant scaling, and the conditional window; `py_compile` and
  `git diff --check` remain to be run.

## R73 — Explicit canonical odd-solver majorant (2026-09-07)

- The webpage again reported that its connector could not read the local R72
  files. I extracted the raw `data-math-source` values from the finished R73
  response and audited those sources locally; this corrected the browser's
  flattened plain-text fraction direction. The accepted normalization is
  `g_m=L[e_m]/sqrt(m!)`, `e_m=H_m/sqrt(m!)`, with
  `d_k=sqrt((2k+1)!)/k!` and odd solve factor `k!/sqrt((2k+1)!)`.
- R73's exact structural contribution is the triangular odd recursion
  `eta_(2k+1)=k!/sqrt((2k+1)!)[alpha_k gamma_k-
  sum_(m<=2k)c_(k,m)eta_m]`; the current odd coordinate is the only new unknown,
  while `phi_k` and the source use earlier moments.
- Under the stated analytic Gram-domain/source estimate, the constants audit to
  `rho=4sqrt(n)`, `sigma=8sqrt(n)`, weighted Gram factor `27/64`, domain bound
  `19/16`, and inverse bound `1024/511`. The source propagation gives
  `B_n=512 n(448n)^n`, `L_n=(1+B_n)^n`, and the Cauchy majorant
  `Omega_n=22L_n^3=exp(O(n^2 log n))`.
- The R72 conditional no-reversal window can therefore be made explicit as
  `a_n#=min{r_n/2,1/(20*4^n U_n),
  sqrt(U_n/[2Omega_n(1+10U_n^2)])}`, with `t_n#=(a_n#)^2`.
  This is a conditional all-order no-reversal interval only; it does not prove
  D.1, an infinite positive exact tower, or backward OU divisibility.
- Added `flat_shadow_odd_solver_bound_r73/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_odd_solver_bound_r73/audit_r73.py`. Next target: degree-local odd
  Green-function sharpening that retains the factorial denominator instead of
  collapsing all levels into `B_n`; aim for `e^(O(n log n))` or `C^n n^p`.

## R74 — Degree-local odd Green kernel and exponential conditional tame (2026-09-07)

- The webpage again reported that the connector could not read the local R72/R73
  files. I used the raw R74 math sources and checked them against the local R73
  normalization. The exact triangular factor is unchanged:
  `d_k=sqrt((2k+1)!)/k!` and `eta_(2k+1)` carries
  `k!/sqrt((2k+1)!)`.
- The new Gaussian product calculation is exact. For `d=k-j`,
  `K_(k,j)<= (1+2d)(16n)^d/d!` and
  `sum_(j<k)K_(k,j)<=(1+32n)e^(16n)-1`. This gives a genuine
  `e^(O(n))` degree-local row bound and isolates R73's
  `e^(O(n^2 log n))` as an artifact of repeatedly applying the uniform `B_n`.
- The finite-head Jacobi/Duhamel route uses the parity fact
  `Delta B=O(E)+O(Y^2)`. Under the explicitly stated Gram-domain and resolvent
  assumptions, the arithmetic yields `C_n=2^25 n^3e^(544n)`,
  `Omega_n=2^26 n^3e^(544n)`, and `r_n=2^(-31)n^(-3)e^(-544n)`.
  The local record treats the full Schur/Duhamel chain as conditional analytic
  input pending a line-by-line resolvent proof; it is not an unconditional
  infinite-law theorem.
- The even bootstrap was recorded with the necessary correction: because the
  angular coefficient is `1/4`, strict improvement uses
  `X<=3|a|Ubar_n/2` from two separate quarter bounds, not the looser
  `2|a|Ubar_n`. For sufficiently large `n`, the conditional no-reversal scales
  are `a_n#=2^(-31)n^(-3)e^(-544n)` and
  `t_n#=2^(-62)n^(-6)e^(-1088n)`.
- Added `flat_shadow_odd_green_r74/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_odd_green_r74/audit_r74.py`. The next unique target is the
  moving-radius Green kernel `sigma_k~sqrt(k)` to reduce the exponent `544` and
  compare the window with `A_(2n)`.

## R75 — Moving-radius conjugation and sign correction (2026-09-07)

- The webpage reported a moving-radius factorization
  `K_(k,j)^mov=(v_k/v_j)q_(k,j)`, with
  `v_k=(k!)^2 sigma_k^(2k+1)/(2k+1)!` and
  `q_(k,j)=(1+2(k-j)/(j+1))/(k-j)!`. The factorization is exact and passed
  local symbolic checks.
- A decisive sign audit found that the signed R73 recursion is
  `Z_k=S_k-sum_(j<k)q_(k,j)Z_j`, not the plus recursion used in the webpage's
  claimed `log(2)` Green resonance. The plus equation is only the absolute-value
  majorant. The correct signed Green formula is
  `F=e^(-2x) integral_0^x e^tS(t)dt` and
  `Z=e^(-x)S-2e^(-2x) integral_0^x e^tS(t)dt`, so it is entire for entire `S`.
- The corrected formula reproduces the audited R64 alternating tangent signs
  from the finite source `S(x)=x+x^2/2`. Therefore the claimed actual spectral
  threshold `(log 2)^(-1)` and nonlinear resonance obstruction are rejected;
  they belong only to a positive majorant that discards cancellation.
- R75's claimed `e^(64mu n/e)` bound was not recorded because its factorial
  summation constant was not independently valid. The full nonlinear tame
  estimate still requires a sign-preserving source identity.
- Added `flat_shadow_odd_green_mov_r75/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_odd_green_mov_r75/audit_r75.py`. Next target: R76 canonical
  nonlinear source cancellation in the corrected signed Green equation.

## R76 — Corrected signed source and factorial-transfer interface (2026-09-07)

- The webpage's connector again returned an account-connection error and did not
  actually read the local R75 files. I extracted the finished R76 response's
  raw math sources and aligned them with the locally audited R75 sign correction.
- The exact source residual is
  `S_k=T_k+sum_(j<k)q_(k,j)Z_j`, so the exact signed recursion remains
  `Z_k=S_k-sum_(j<k)q_(k,j)Z_j`. This separates the canonical signed source from
  the positive absolute-value majorant.
- Reflection and exact Gaussian linearization yield the formal/analytic Gram
  neighborhood ideal
  `S_tilde in a(E,Y^2)+EY+Y^3` after subtracting
  `a S^(1)`, `S^(1)(x)=x+x^2/2`; for `k>=3`, `S_k in EY+Y^3`. Under
  `Y=O(a), E=O(a^2)`, the nonlinear odd source therefore starts at cubic order.
- The corrected Volterra solution is entire-source preserving:
  `Z=e^(-x)S-2e^(-2x) integral_0^x e^tS(t)dt`. The R64 tangent source gives
  the alternating coefficients exactly, so no signed `log(2)` resonance remains.
- Conditional factorial transfer was audited: if
  `|S_k|<=M mu^k/k!`, then `|Z_k|<=C_mu M lambda_mu^k/k!`,
  `lambda_mu=max(2,mu+1)`, with only a `k+1` factor at `mu=1`. The common-radius
  conversion at `sigma_n=8sqrt(n)` was checked using
  `(2k+1)!/k! >= (k+1)!`.
- The remaining analytic interface is `FS_mu`, a fixed-`C,mu` degree-local
  factorial bound for `S_tilde`. It is explicitly still OPEN; R76 does not prove
  D.1, a positive infinite exact backward tower, or backward OU divisibility.
- Added `flat_shadow_odd_green_source_r76/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_odd_green_source_r76/audit_r76.py`. Next target: R77 Gram-to-source
  factorial estimate, or its smallest rigorous failure boundary.

## R77 — Local Gram-to-source factorial estimate (2026-09-07)

- The webpage again reported that its connector could not read the local R76
  files. I extracted the finished R77 raw math sources and checked the arithmetic
  against the R76 signed-source baseline.
- R77 proves a degree-local theorem on the explicit Hermite–Wiener ball
  `rho_k=4sqrt(k)`, `||E||_(rho_k)+||Y||_(rho_k)<=1/40`: for every fixed
  `mu>3`, `k!|S_tilde_k|<=C_mu mu^k Xi_k`, with constants independent of `k,n`.
  The endpoint `FS_3` remains open.
- The Gram perturbation ratio is exactly `(sqrt(3)/2)^m`; hence
  `C_G=(sqrt(3)/2)^3/(1-sqrt(3)/2)<5`, the inverse norm is at most `8/7`, and
  the displayed first-to-third inverse-derivative bounds have no `k!` or `n`
  dependence on this small ball.
- The source numerator's degree growth is controlled by
  `q_mu=mu+1`, `p_mu=2(mu+1)/(mu-3)`, and
  `||x psi chi||_2<=||x||_(p_mu)mu^k||psi||_2||chi||_2`. This proves the
  `mu>3` base; the blow-up `p_mu->infinity` at `mu=3` is the current method's
  explicit failure boundary, not a proof of optimality.
- Parity/Taylor structure still gives `EY+Y^3` for `k>=3`; finite head gives
  `a(E+Y^2)` after tangent subtraction. Lower-odd Volterra feedback is not
  re-convolved inside the source estimate.
- Combining `mu=3+epsilon` with the R76 signed transfer gives conditional
  `exp((256+64epsilon)n)` odd control and the conservative common-radius scales
  `|a|<=c_epsilon n^(-1/4)e^(-(288+32epsilon)n)`,
  `t<=c_epsilon^2 n^(-1/2)e^(-(576+64epsilon)n)`. This improves the earlier
  `e^(-1088n)` scale but remains far below the angular natural scale.
- This is a local conditional theorem, not a global theorem from Gram
  positivity alone. D.1, the positive backward tower, backward OU divisibility,
  and the endpoint `FS_3` remain OPEN. The next target is factorial-type even
  bootstrap without common-radius conversion.
- Added `flat_shadow_odd_green_source_r77/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_odd_green_source_r77/audit_r77.py`.

## R78 — Same-radius factorial even bootstrap (2026-09-07)

- The webpage again reported that its connector could not read the local R77
  files. I extracted the completed R78 raw math sources and audited their
  coefficient arithmetic against the R77/R76 baselines.
- Under the explicit same-factor angular coefficient bounds
  `|C_(r,s)+C_(s,r)|<=2A_(2k)` and `|D_(r,s,t)|<=A_(2k)`, the exact even source
  obeys `|E_(2k)|<=sum|f_r f_s|+sum|f_r f_s f_t|`. Thus the arbitrary-source
  `(3/2)^k` angular inverse loss is absent from the actual same-factor source.
- In the single coefficient Wiener norm
  `||g||_n=sum|g_m|(4sqrt(n))^m`, the even equation closes as
  `||E||_n<=||E+Y||_n^2+||E+Y||_n^3`, with no additional `rho_n->sigma_n`
  conversion and no separate `4^n` factor.
- Combining R77 `FS_(3+epsilon)` and R76 signed transfer gives
  `Gamma_(n,mu)=K_mu n^(-1/2)[16e(mu+1)]^n` for the odd correction in the same
  norm. The audited R64 tangent satisfies
  `H_n<=8/3 n^(3/2)16^n`.
- With `x=|a|H_n`, the local bootstrap `||Y||<=2x`, `||E||<=8x^2`,
  `x<=1/100` closes when `36Gamma x^2<=1`, yielding conditional
  `a#=H_n^(-1)min{1/100,[36Gamma]^(-1/2)}` and
  `t#=(a#)^2`. For large n this has sufficient scale
  `a# >= [16sqrt(K_mu)]^(-1)n^(-5/4)[64sqrt(e(mu+1))]^(-n)` and
  `t# >= [256K_mu]^(-1)n^(-5/2)[4096e(mu+1)]^(-n)`.
- The result is local and conditional on the exact same-factor angular
  coefficient bounds and R77 Gram ball. It does not prove D.1, a positive
  infinite backward tower, or backward OU divisibility, and it remains far below
  `A_(2n)~3(2/3)^n/sqrt(pi n)` because the tangent has size `~16^n` in this
  growing norm.
- The next target is tangent-centered Gram/source bootstrap:
  `G_n(a)=I+aA_n+R_n(a)` with bounded `A_n`, controlling only `(E,o)` while
  treating `aU` as background. Added
  `flat_shadow_even_same_radius_r78/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_even_same_radius_r78/audit_r78.py`.

## R79 — Tangent-centered Gram/source bootstrap (2026-09-07)

- The completed webpage R79 response was extracted and recorded locally. Its
  main structural lemma is the exact decomposition
  `G_n(a,E,o)=I+aA_n+Hcal_n(E+o)`, with
  `A_n=P_n M_(g_1) P_n` and `sup_n ||A_n||_op<=||g_1||_infinity`. Thus the
  Gaussian tangent is handled as a bounded operator background rather than as
  a coefficient-Wiener small quantity.
- With `R_n=4sqrt(n)`, the residual Gram operator obeys
  `||Hcal_n(h)||_op<=C_G||h||_n`, `C_G<5`. On
  `|a|M_1+C_G(||E||_n+||o||_n)<=1/2`, Neumann control gives
  `||G_n^(-1)||_op<=2`; the first three resolvent derivatives depend on
  `M_1|dot a|+C_G||dot h||_n`, not `|a| ||U||_n`.
- Reflection gives `P G_n(a,E,o) P=G_n(-a,E,-o)`. After writing
  `Y=aU+o` and subtracting the R64 finite-head tangent source, the local
  signed source has the ideal form `E(a,o)+(a,o)^3`; conditionally for
  `mu>3`, `k!|S_tilde_k|<=C_mu mu^k[(|a|+O)E_*+(|a|+O)^3]`.
- Combining with R78, `x=|a|H_n` gives `E_*<=5x^2` and, when
  `48 Gamma_(n,mu)x^2<=1`, `O<=x/2`. The tangent norm satisfies
  `H_n<=4n^3(4e)^n`, while
  `Gamma_(n,mu)=K_mu n^(-1/2)[16e(mu+1)]^n`. The resulting conditional
  window has the sufficient scale
  `a#>=c_mu n^(-11/4)[4e sqrt(16e(mu+1))]^(-n)` and square scale
  `n^(-11/2)[256e^3(mu+1)]^(-n)`.
- The key failure boundary is explicit rather than hidden: the scalar feedback
  `E=x^2`, `O=Gamma(aE+EO)` solves to
  `O=Gamma aE/(1-Gamma E)`. Hence bounded `A_n` removes the Gram-centering
  penalty but does not remove the residual `Gamma E_*<1` condition. D.1,
  positive backward tower, backward OU divisibility, global positivity closure,
  and endpoint `FS_3` remain OPEN.
- Added `flat_shadow_tangent_centered_r79/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_tangent_centered_r79/audit_r79.py`. Next target: R80 quadratic
  even centered operator lemma for `E=a^2V+Ehat`, or a direct uniform signed
  Green `O(a^2)` bound for the `a^2V` contribution.

## R80 — Quadratic-even centered operator lemma (2026-09-07)

- The webpage completed R80 but again reported that its bridge could not read
  the local R79 files. The local record therefore treats the response as a
  proposed continuation of the audited R64/R79 baseline, with status labels
  for unconditional identities, conditional transport, and OPEN claims.
- The Beta inverse for the angular operator was verified exactly. The displayed
  `R^6,R^8,R^10,R^12` Gaussian multiplier polynomial was verified symbolically
  after imposing the necessary relation `alpha=xi+eta`.
- The endpoint integral in the webpage was independently tightened. On a
  symmetry quarter, `I<=32J`; the exact integral after `x=as,y=bu` is
  `J=sqrt(ab)/(4(a+b))<=1/8`, hence `I<=4`, not merely `I<=32`.
  This gives `||g_2||_infinity<=4C_*` for the explicit quadratic multiplier.
- The inverse-Hermite formula was checked for degrees 0 through 3, and the
  fixed-point bootstrap arithmetic for `delta=10^(-4)` was checked exactly.
  The corrected dominant safe-window base is
  `t# >= c_mu n^(-5/2)[64e^2(mu+1)]^(-n)`; its ratio to the angular scale is
  `O_mu(n^(-2)[3/(128e^2(mu+1))]^n)`.
- Conditional structural conclusion: with `E=a^2V+Ehat`, the quadratic
  response can be absorbed as `I+aA_n+a^2B_n^(2)` with uniformly bounded Gram
  compression. This removes the old `Gamma a^2H_n^2` feedback and leaves the
  improved `Gamma a^2H_n` sufficient condition.
- The stronger target `||signed-Green D_E S[V]||=O(1)` uniformly in n remains
  OPEN. Bounded multiplier/Gram compression alone controls the L2 operator
  background, not the growing coefficient-Wiener re-summation. The next target
  is the mixed tangent-residual composition
  `o -> A^(-1)Q(U,o) -> signed-Green D_E S`.

  `flat_shadow_quadratic_even_r80/audit_r80.py`.

## R81 — Mixed tangent–residual operator cancellation (2026-09-07)

- The webpage completed R81 but again reported that the bridge could not read
  the R80 local files or independently check HEAD `7c42885`. The local record
  keeps the response conditional on the existing formal same-factor/Jacobi
  hierarchy.
- Exact structural reduction: with `E=a^2V+Ehat` and `Y=aU+o`, the mixed loop
  has `D_o Ehat=-2a M_n` and `D_Ehat o=a L_n`, hence the Jacobian is
  `-2a^2 K_n` with `K_n=L_n M_n`. This isolates the feedback that R80 bounded
  separately by `Gamma_n H_n`.
- New positive lemma before angular inversion: bounded Gaussian multiplier legs
  satisfy a conditional Gaussian Wick-contraction bound, so the actual
  `U`-mixed source has dimension-free `L_infinity` norm at most
  `3||g_1||_infinity||h||_infinity` because `r_i^2+r_j^2<=1`.
- Two strict no-go boundaries were audited. Generic angular inversion has mode
  growth `A_(2k)^(-1)~sqrt(pi k)(3/2)^k/3`; and strict lower-triangular
  Gram-Schmidt truncation can grow at least `c log N` even when the full Gram
  perturbation has bounded operator norm. Thus R80's bounded Gram compression
  alone cannot imply a uniform mixed source derivative.
- The exact missing input is a weighted `l^1` column condition for the mixed
  kernel. With `omega_(n,j)=((j!)^2/(2j+1)!)R_n^(2j+1)`, fixed gap `d` has
  weight ratio asymptotic `(4n)^d`, requiring `K_(j+d,j)=O(n^(-d))` absent
  cross-degree cancellation.
- Conditional theorem: if `MGK(C_K)` holds, the mixed-linear feedback changes
  from `Gamma_n a^2 H_n` to `2C_K a^2<1`. The existing quartic residual still
  gives only `t#>=c_mu n^(-23/4)[64e^2 sqrt(e(mu+1))]^(-n)`, with fixed-
  `mu downarrow3` base `128e^2 sqrt(e)`; the angular scale remains far away.
- Added `flat_shadow_mixed_kernel_r81/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_mixed_kernel_r81/audit_r81.py`.

## R82 — Exact degree-local mixed kernel and actual d=4 obstruction (2026-09-07)

- The webpage completed R82 but again reported that the bridge could not read
  R81 local records or independently verify HEAD `1a3839f`. The result is
  recorded conditionally on the formal same-factor/Jacobi hierarchy.
- It supplied the complete finite/formal kernel for
  `o_(2j+1) -> A_e^(-1)Q(U,o) -> D_E S -> signed Green`, retaining `j`, `k`,
  and the gap. The local audit checks the first channels at fixed exact degrees.
- The first allowed channel is
  `K_(j+3,j)=2(j+6)/[3(j+1)(j+2)(j+3)^2]~2/(3j^3)`, so the d=3 weighted
  column remains bounded.
- The next actual canonical channel is
  `K_(j+4,j)=-(3j^3+146j^2+1001j+1560)/[15(j+1)(j+2)(j+3)^2(j+4)^2]`
  `~-1/(5j^3)`. Since the R81 weight ratio is `(4n)^4` at fixed gap, this
  single channel forces the weighted norm to grow at least linearly in `n`.
  Thus the uniform `MGK(C_K)` conjecture is strictly false in the actual
  canonical kernel, rather than merely unsupported by an arbitrary-matrix
  example.
- More generally, a single radius `R_n=c n^alpha` would need `alpha<=3/8` for
  the d=4 mixed channel but `alpha>=1/2` for degree-four dimension-free Gram
  control. This rules out repairing both sides by changing one power radius.
- The strongest current alternative is polynomial-growth analysis: if the full
  all-gap kernel is `O(n^p)`, the already exponentially shrinking R80 window
  may still absorb the mixed linear loop. Growing-gap exponential lower bounds
  would force a hybrid Gram/triangular norm.
- Added `flat_shadow_exact_mixed_kernel_r82/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_exact_mixed_kernel_r82/audit_r82.py`.

## R83 — All-gap mixed-kernel growth and fixed-gap generating function (2026-09-07)

- The webpage completed R83 but again said the bridge could not read the R82
  local files.  Its result is recorded conditionally on the formal
  same-factor/Jacobi hierarchy, while the local audit verifies the finite
  algebra independently.
- The exact root-of-unity angular filter yields, for fixed `r`,
  `B_(r,j)=-1/(2*4^r)+O_r(j^(-1))`.  The exact Hermite-band formula for `q_l`
  gives `p_(l,l-s)=2l^(2s-2)/(s-1)!+O_s(l^(2s-3))`, and the signed Green has
  an explicit finite gap coefficient with leading term `(-1)^g/g!`.
- Combining these three blocks produces a common `j^(-3)` fixed-gap scale.
  The source-band `exp(z)` and signed-Green `exp(-z)` factors cancel, giving
  `K_(j+d,j)=kappa_d j^(-3)+O_d(j^(-4))` with
  `kappa_d=2(-1)^(d-1)(d-2)(d-1)!/(2d-3)!` for every fixed `d>=3`.
- The fixed-gap generating function is
  `sum_(d>=3)kappa_d z^d=4z^(3/2)U(sqrt(z))`, and its coefficients are all
  nonzero with factorial gap decay.  The first two terms recover R82's
  `2/3` and `-1/5` channels.
- Under the R82 weight, every fixed gap contributes
  `4^d|kappa_d|theta^(-3)n^(d-3)(1+o(1))` when `j/n->theta`.  Hence, choosing a
  fixed `d>p+3` for any fixed `p`, one obtains a strict lower bound faster than
  `n^p`.  The current weighted mixed norm has no finite polynomial envelope.
  This is not yet an exponential lower bound because the fixed-gap remainder
  is not uniform when `d` grows with `j`.
- The route must therefore switch from a hoped-for polynomial bound in the
  `4sqrt(n)` coefficient-Wiener norm to a hybrid norm.  Rescaling weights by
  `n^(-j)` removes the fixed-gap obstruction and leaves a summable `4^d` profile,
  but Gram and strict-triangular stability still require separate components.
  The next target is the two-parameter regime `d/j->delta` or, first,
  a uniform moderate-gap estimate for `d=o(sqrt(j))`.
- Added `flat_shadow_all_gap_r83/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_all_gap_r83/audit_r83.py`.  Exact audit passed:
  `R83_ROOT_FILTER_AND_HERMITE_BAND_PASSED`,
  `R83_GREEN_AND_FIXED_GAP_KAPPA_PASSED`,

  `R83_ALL_GAP_AUDIT_COMPLETED`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.

## R84 — Uniform logarithmic moderate-gap extension (2026-09-07)

- R84 read the R83 local records through the bridge and obtained a uniform
  moderate-gap route.  The exact Green coefficient has the positive-integral
  representation with no artificial `3^g` loss.  Angular root-filter and
  Hermite top-band estimates are proposed uniformly with relative errors
  `O(r^2/j)` and `O(s^2/ell)` in the logarithmic range.
- Because the leading source/Green cancellation is ill-conditioned, the safe
  relative bound is `C(d^2/j)e^(8d)`, not the stronger `exp(O(d^2/j))` without
  further cancellation.  This yields the formal uniform theorem
  `K_(j+d,j)=kappa_d j^(-3)[1+O((log j)^2/sqrt(j))]` for
  `3<=d<=log(j)/16`.
- Taking `d_n=floor(c log n)+3` and `j=floor(n/2)` gives an actual
  stretched-superpolynomial lower bound in the original `4sqrt(n)` weighted
  norm:
  `exp[c_*(log n)^2-c_*(log n)loglog n-C_*(log n)]`.
  This is `e^(o(n))`, not an exponential-in-`n` claim.
- The rescaled coefficient weight `n^(-j)omega_(n,j)` is uniformly tame over
  the full logarithmic moderate-gap sector because its gap ratio is
  `4^d exp(O(d^2/j))` and `sum_d4^d|kappa_d|` converges.  Full hybrid Gram /
  triangular stability and proportional-gap behavior remain open.
- A parameterization error was caught and corrected: with `delta=j/r`, the
  saddle parameter must be `rho=r/(j+r)=1/(1+delta)` (or
  `rho=delta/(1+delta)` if `delta=r/j)`, not `(1+delta)/delta`.  The local
  record and next prompt use the corrected form.
- Added `flat_shadow_moderate_gap_r84/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_moderate_gap_r84/audit_r84.py`. Exact audit passed:

  passed.

## R85 — Proportional-gap joint saddle and signed-cancellation boundary (2026-09-07)

- The webpage completed R85 after reading the R84 direction.  Its strict new
  result is the full-kernel one-sided bound, within the formal
  same-factor/Jacobi hierarchy,
  `limsup j^(-1) log(j^d |K_(j+d,j)|) <= delta(1+log(3/delta))`
  for `d/j -> delta>0`.  Equivalently,
  `|K_(j+d,j)| <= j^(-d) exp(j*delta(1+log(3/delta))+o(j))`.
  This proves proportional channels are at most exponential under the
  original `4sqrt(n)` weight and super-exponentially tame after the `n^(-j)`
  coefficient rescaling.  It is not an actual proportional lower bound.
- The exact root-filter representation and corrected normalization remain:
  `rho=r/(j+r)`, hence `rho=1/(1+delta)` for `delta=j/r` and
  `rho=delta/(1+delta)` for `delta=r/j`; the saddle polynomial is
  `1+(1-omega)(2rho-1)x-omega x^2=0`.
- The signed Green has exact positive-integral representation
  `G=(-1)^g/g![1+2g integral t^ell(2-t)^(g-1)dt]`.  Its interior rate is
  `J_G=L log(2L/(L+gamma))+gamma log(2gamma/(L+gamma))`, and along
  `L=1+delta-gamma` its derivative is `log(gamma/L)`.
- The proportional Hermite/source endpoint has nonzero factor
  `p_(ell,ell-s)/T_0 -> (1-lambda)/(1+lambda)^3`; the first and second
  endpoint groups have fixed-a ratios
  `(-1)^a binom(a+2,2)lambda^a` and the same multiplied by `lambda`.
  The source–mixed factorial cancellation leaves `1/(r!s!)` and the angular
  factor at exponential scale.  The local finite anchors also verify the
  positive prefactor
  `2*sqrt(pi)*alpha^(3/2)*beta*sqrt(1+alpha)/(1+alpha+2beta)^3` after
  factoring out `(-1)^r B_(r,j) j^(-1/2)/(r!s!)`.
- Dropping angular decay and maximizing the absolute real action gives
  `delta(1+log(3/delta))`.  On the Green interior branch the local calculus
  makes the monotonicity explicit:
  with `a=alpha+beta` and `alpha=beta=a/2`,
  `dF/da=log(2(1+a)/a)>0`, so the branch reaches `gamma=L`, after which
  entropy concavity gives the equal split upper bound.
- There is a strict signed-phase obstruction on the real simplex.  The
  gamma equation is `log(beta/gamma)+i*pi=0` when `gamma<L` and
  `log(beta/L)+i*pi=0` when `gamma>L`, so no positive-real signed saddle
  exists.  Formal cancellation `gamma=-beta` forces `alpha=delta` and gives
  the candidate `delta(1-log(delta))+Lambda_A(delta)`, but the required
  contour/phase statement `PSC_delta` is not proved.  Mesoscopic bridge,
  actual proportional lower/equality, full hybrid norm, R80 safe-window,
  D.1, positivity, backward tower/OU divisibility and `FS_3` remain OPEN.
- Added `flat_shadow_proportional_saddle_r85/README.md` and

## R86 — Exact Green-resummed generating identity and endpoint correction (2026-09-07)

- R86 returned a PLAN centered on folding the whole signed `s/g` convolution
  into one generating series.  With
  `R_m(z)=sum_(s>=1)R_(m+s,m)z^s` and
  `S_j(z)=sum_(r>=1)M_(j+r+1,j)z^(r+1)R_(j+r+1)(z)`, the exact formal identity is
  `K_j(z)=e^(-z)S_j(z)-2ze^(-2z)integral_0^1e^(zu)u^jS_j(zu)du`, with
  `[z^d]K_j(z)=K_(j+d,j)`.  The local audit matches this series coefficient by
  coefficient against the previous exact finite kernel for several finite
  `j,d` blocks.
- The first-term action
  `Phi_1=Phi_A(alpha)+alpha+beta-alpha log alpha-beta log beta`
  `+(alpha+beta-delta)Log zeta-zeta` has stationary equations
  `beta=zeta` and `zeta=alpha+beta-delta`, hence `alpha=delta` and
  `gamma=-beta`.  The full complex angular action must include the external
  root-filter phase `2alpha Log(omega)`.
- The second Green action gives
  `zeta=-gamma/(2-u)=-L/u`, `L=1+alpha+beta`, and
  `u_*=2L/(L+gamma)`.  The transition `u_*=1` is exactly `gamma=L`.
- Endpoint expansion produces the corrected Green factor
  `P_G=1-2zeta/(L+zeta)=(L-zeta)/(L+zeta)`.  At the formal PSC point this is
  `(1+delta)/(1+delta+2zeta)`.  The inverse factor would be wrong; exact
  symbolic algebra and finite Green anchors verify the correction.  This
  does not prove that the complex endpoint contour is legal or dominant.
- The local audit also verifies the exact source coefficient identity, the
  saddle derivatives and phase bookkeeping, the `g<j` Green factorial
  majorant arithmetic, and the multinomial bound
  `sum_{r+s+g=D}1/(r!s!g!)=3^D/D!`.
- R86 therefore closes the exact resummation and corrects a sensitive
  prefactor, but not `PSC_delta`: complex source endpoint continuation,
  endpoint/interior separation, and conjugate angular phase remain OPEN.
  The candidate `delta(1-log delta)+Phi_A(delta)` is still conditional.
- Added `flat_shadow_green_resummed_r86/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_green_resummed_r86/audit_r86.py`. Exact audit passed:

  passed.

## R87 — Small-proportional safety window audit and endpoint correction (2026-09-07)

- The webpage proposed a two-track R87 plan: close a small-proportional
  `PSC_delta`, or fall back to an all-gap/mesoscopic factorial upper bound in
  the `n^(-j)`-rescaled coefficient component.  The plan was not accepted
  wholesale because its endpoint factors were written in both orientations.
- Exact symbolic audit confirms the continuous root-filter branch through
  `x(0)=1` is locally analytic and nondegenerate, and the complete-phase
  envelope derivative gives
  `zeta=4*alpha*x/(omega^2*(1+omega*x)^2)=4*alpha+O(alpha^2)`.
  Hence `Delta=1+alpha+2*zeta=1+9*alpha+O(alpha^2)`.
- The proportional source variable is `lambda=zeta/L`, with
  `L=1+alpha+zeta`, not its reciprocal.  Therefore
  `P_H=Delta^3/((1+alpha)L^2)`.  Preserving the R86 correction gives
  `P_G=(L-zeta)/(L+zeta)=(1+alpha)/Delta`, and the correct product is
  `P_H*P_G=Delta^2/L^2`.  The inverse Green factor and its induced
  `Delta^4/((1+alpha)^2L^2)` product are explicitly rejected.
- On the original real Green segment, if `Re(Delta)>=eta>0`, then
  `Re(phi'(u))=Re(Delta)+(1/u-1)Re(L)>=eta`; this closes only the endpoint
  monotonicity algebra.  Uniform complex source amplitude bounds and source
  endpoint continuation remain open.
- The conjugate-phase target needs the nondegeneracy condition
  `Theta not in pi*Z` or `Re(C)!=0`; `C!=0` alone admits an identically
  cancelling pure-imaginary example.  The local audit records this exact
  logical correction.
- The finite fallback convolution satisfies the exact multinomial identity
  `sum 1/(r!s!g!)=3^D/D!`, but the proposed angular `(1+r)^2` factor leaves
  an explicit `(1+D)^2`; the polynomial exponent in the target upper bound
  must therefore be recalibrated before claiming closure.

## R88 — Explicit real-u endpoint lemma under a uniform amplitude hypothesis (2026-09-07)

- The webpage selected route A and supplied a concrete one-integration-by-
  parts lemma for the real Green segment.  The local record treats it as an
  abstract theorem for a prescribed normalized source amplitude, not as a
  bound for the actual source series.
- Under `Re(Delta)>=eta>0`, `Re(L)>=ell_0>0`, and
  `sup(|A_j|+|A_j'|)<=M`, with `phi(u)=zeta*u+L*Log(u)`, exact differentiation
  gives `B=A_j/phi'=A_j*u/(zeta*u+L)` and
  `B'=A_j'*u/(zeta*u+L)+A_j*L/(zeta*u+L)^2`.
  Integration by parts yields
  `I_j=e^(j*zeta)A_j(1)/(j*Delta)+R_j` with
  `|R_j| <= (M/eta)(1/c+L_max/c^2)e^(j*Re(zeta))/j^2`,
  `c=min(eta,ell_0)`.
- If `|A_j(1)|>=m>0`, this becomes a relative `1+O(j^(-1))` expansion.  The
  exact Green operator then realizes the corrected factor
  `P_G=(L-zeta)/(L+zeta)=(1+alpha)/Delta`; with the separately conditional
  source factor `P_H`, the product is `Delta^2/L^2`.
- The remaining PSC gaps are now sharply isolated: actual complex source
  `C^1` amplitude/endpoint nonvanishing, `z`-Cauchy contour legality and
  Stokes control, and nondegenerate angular conjugate phase. No proportional
  lower/equality is claimed.

## R89 — Source factorization, moving-saddle obstruction, and conditional absolute majorant (2026-09-07)

- R89 tested the R88 global fixed-saddle amplitude hypothesis against the
  fully resummed source.  The local record defines
  `T_(m,s)=2(s-1)!*binom(m+s+1,s-1)*binom(m+s-3,s-1)` and
  `Xi_(m,s)=p_(m+s,m)/T_(m,s)`, then verifies the exact identity
  `R_(m+s,m)=-4*(2m)!/((m+2)!(m-2)!)*D_(m,s)*Xi_(m,s)/(s-1)!`.
  This avoids the webpage's mixed `Theta`/`1/Theta` convention.
- The same identity gives a formal Poisson-type coefficient representation
  for `R_m(z)`, but no complex asymptotic is inferred from it.
- A second sensitive algebraic correction was found: with `y=omega*x`, the
  audited PSC formula becomes
  `zeta=4*alpha*y/(1+y)^2`, not its reciprocal.  On the continuous real
  branch, the transformed quadratic has unit-circle roots and this corrected
  expression is positive real.
- In the leading model `R_m(z) proportional to z*e^z`, the frozen source
  normalization has logarithmic modulus
  `j*[zeta*(u-1-log u)-alpha*log u]+log u`, which is positive for fixed
  `0<u<1` and `zeta>0`.  Thus the global R88 `C^1` amplitude assumption fails
  already in the leading model.  This is a no-go for that normalization, not
  a no-go for PSC; a moving-saddle or boundary-layer proof is required.
- Conditional on a source band majorant
  `|Xi_(m,s)|<=C exp(C*s^2/m)`, the exact factorization plus the R87
  angular/Green targets gives the precise conditional bound
  `|K_(j+D+1,j)|<=C*j^(-3)*(1+D)^3*3^D/D!*exp(C*D^2/j)`.
  The `(1+D)^3` factor is explicit and is not hidden in a polynomial `q`.
- The exact rescaled coefficient-weight ratio is
  `16^D*c_(j+D)/c_j`
  `=prod_(h=1)^D 8*(j+h)/(2*(j+h)+1)<4^D`; this is the corrected weight
  input for the conditional mesoscopic closure.

## R90 — Source-band theorem recovered after formula correction (2026-09-07)

- The webpage supplied a strong candidate: `|Xi_(m,s)|<28` for
  `m>=8`, `1<=s<=m/8`.  The local review found that its displayed normalized
  factorial ratios were inverted: literal substitution at `a=0` gives
  `A_(m,s,0)=(m+s-3)^2`, contradicting the required normalization `A_0=1`.
  The central-binomial inequality was also written in the inverse orientation.
- Re-derived from the R83 exact band formula, the corrected terms are
  `A=(-1)^(a+1)(a+1)(a+2)/4*[a^2+5a-2(m+s)+6]` times
  `(m+s-a-4)!/(m+s-3)!`, `(s-1)!/(s-a-1)!`,
  `(m+2)!/(m+a+2)!`, `(m-2)!/(m-a-2)!`; `B` has the analogous
  `(m+s)/(m+s+1)`, `(m+s-a-5)!/(m+s-3)!`, and `s-a-2` factors.
  These corrected closed forms match every exact finite band term checked and
  give `A_0=1`.
- With `q=s/(m-2)<=1/6`, finite-product bounds prove
  `|A_a|<=(a+3)^4 q^a/8` and
  `|B_a|<=(a+4)^4 q^(a+1)/8`.  The exact infinite geometric-polynomial sum is
  `681843/25000<28`, so the source theorem is now **PROVED** on this band,
  rather than merely conditional on `exp(C*s^2/m)`.
- Combining the exact R89 factorization with `D_(m,s)<=9/m^2` and the correct
  upper bound `(2m)!/((m+2)!(m-2)!)<=4^m/sqrt(m)` gives
  `|R_(m+s,m)|<=1008*4^m*m^(-5/2)/(s-1)!`.
- Corrected the weight bookkeeping as well:
  `tilde omega_(n,j+D)/tilde omega_(n,j)=16^D c_(j+D)/c_j`
  `=prod_(h=1)^D 8(j+h)/(2(j+h)+1)<4^D`; for output `K_(j+D+1,j)` use
  `D+1`.
- Added `flat_shadow_source_majorant_r90/README.md` and `audit_r90.js`.
  Exact audit output:

## R91 — Mesoscopic angular, Green, and full-kernel closure (2026-09-07)

- R91 proposed a global angular estimate and a `D<=j/8` Green estimate.  The
  webpage's central-binomial induction ratio was backwards; after correction,
  `a_(k+1)/a_k=(2k+1)/(2k+2)` and the squared step follows from the exact
  difference `1`.
- Exact root-filter probability gives `0<=rho<=3`, hence `|B_(r,j)|<=1`.
  Together with the corrected central-binomial lower bound,
  `c_j=(j!)^2/(2j+1)!` and `upsilon_r` yield the global actual angular bound
  `|M_(j+r+1,j)|<=4^(-j-r)j^(-1/2)(r+1)^2/r!`.
- From the exact Green coefficient,
  `G=(-1)^g/g!*[1+2g integral_0^1 t^ell(2-t)^(g-1)dt]`, the inequality
  `t(2-t)<=1` gives `|G|<=9/(7g!)` whenever `D=r+s+g<=j/8`.
- Combining R90 source, the angular bound, and this Green bound gives the
  exact path majorant `5184*j^(-3)(r+1)^2*s/(r!s!g!)`.  Its exact convolution
  is `(3^D/D!)*D(D^2+6D+2)/27`, so the full mixed kernel satisfies
  `|K_(j+D+1,j)|<=192*j^(-3)D(D^2+6D+2)3^D/D!` for
  `j>=16`, `2<=D<=j/8`.
- With the R90 global ratio `<4^(D+1)`, the whole rescaled weighted interval
  obeys `sum_{2<=D<=j/8}|K|*weight_ratio <=2405376*e^12*j^(-3)`.
  This upgrades an entire interval-level coefficient-propagation statement
  from CONDITIONAL to PROVED under the existing exact decomposition.
- Added `flat_shadow_mesoscopic_kernel_r91/README.md` and `audit_r91.js`.
  Exact audit output:
  `R91_CENTRAL_BINOMIAL_INDUCTION_PASSED`,
  `R91_ANGULAR_MAJORANT_ANCHORS_PASSED`,
  `R91_GREEN_WINDOW_BOUND_PASSED`,
  `R91_CONVOLUTION_IDENTITY_AND_CONSTANTS_PASSED`, and
  `R91_MESOSCOPIC_KERNEL_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.
- The next overall bottleneck is now sharply localized to the compact-uniform
  large-gap sector `D/j>=1/8`; PSC lower/equality and the positive backward
  tower remain higher-level open problems.

## R92 — Global source bound and all-gap rescaled closure (2026-09-07)

- R92 found a direct route around uniformizing the R85 proportional saddle:
  the corrected R90 exact `A/B` sums have support `a<=m-2`, the `m`-factor
  product is at most one, and factorial pairing gives a coarse global theorem
  `|Xi_(m,s)|<=16*(m+s)^4` for `m>=3`, `s>=1`.  The `s=1,2` heads are handled
  separately; no fixed-gap asymptotic is extrapolated to moving `s`.
- With the exact source factorization and the correctly oriented
  `(2m)!/((m+2)!(m-2)!)<=4^m/sqrt(m)`, this gives
  `|R_(m+s,m)|<=576*4^m*m^(-5/2)*(m+s)^4*s/s!` globally on the source indices.
- The exact Green coefficient has the global absolute bound
  `|G|<=1/g!+2^g/((ell+1)(g-1)!)` for `g>=1`, with `G=1` for `g=0`.
  Splitting these two Green pieces and using the exact R91 angular bound gives
  the all-gap kernel upper with bases `3^D/D!` and `4^D/D!`:
  `|K| <= (256/3)j^(-3)(j+D+1)^4 D(D^2+6D+2)3^D/D!`
  ` +18j^(-3)(j+D+1)^3 D(D-1)(D^2+7D-2)4^D/D!`.
- R90 weight `<4^(D+1)` turns these into `12^D/D!` and `16^D/D!`.
  The R91 interval `D<=j/8` and the R92 tail `D>=j/8` therefore combine to
  prove a globally bounded `n^(-j)`-rescaled mixed coefficient column.
- Added `flat_shadow_global_tail_r92/README.md` and `audit_r92.js`.
  Exact audit output:
  `R92_GLOBAL_SOURCE_ANCHORS_PASSED maxRatio=1/4096`,
  `R92_GLOBAL_GREEN_BOUND_ANCHORS_PASSED`,
  `R92_GLOBAL_CONVOLUTION_IDENTITIES_PASSED`,
  `R92_TAIL_ARITHMETIC_PASSED`, and
  `R92_GLOBAL_TAIL_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.
- This closes the coefficient-propagation branch at the rescaled norm.  The
  next central problem is no longer source/angle/Green, but hybrid
  Gram/strict-triangular stability; PSC lower/equality and positive backward
  tower/OU-divisibility remain separate open layers.

## R93 — Weighted Volterra stability versus Gram triangular loss (2026-09-07)

- R93 explicitly separated the mixed coefficient kernel `K` from the unrelated
  Gram--Schmidt strict-lower projection `L_-`.  The former raises degree; the
  latter truncates matrix entries.  No conclusion about one is silently used for
  the other.
- From R91's mesoscopic column bound and R92's all-gap majorant, the corrected
  weight ratio `<4^(D+1)` gives, for `D>=j/8`, the safe tail majorant
  `C92 D^7 16^D/D!`, with `C92=31,008,000`.  Hence
  `kappa_j=w_j^(-1)sum_(k>j)w_k|K_(k,j)|` tends to zero, not merely remains bounded.
- On `ell^1(w)`, `||K-KP_J||=sup_(j>=J)kappa_j ->0`; `KP_J` is finite rank.
  Therefore the formal mixed kernel is compact.  The finite-head/small-tail
  block form `K=[[K_H,0],[C,K_T]]`, with `K_H` nilpotent and
  `||K_T||<=epsilon_J`, gives for every fixed `lambda` a uniform-in-`n`
  resolvent bound for `K^(n)=P_nKP_n`, and the same argument gives
  `sigma(K)={0}`.  This is a compact quasinilpotent/Volterra-type theorem for
  the rescaled coefficient propagation layer.
- The minimal obstruction to a weaker inference is the unilateral shift:
  bounded strict triangular columns and nilpotence do not prevent
  `||(I-S_N)^(-1)||=N`.  The actual additional ingredient is column vanishing.
- Separately, Fourier coefficient extraction proves
  `||L_-H||_op <= (1+log N)||H||_op`.  The R81 discrete Hilbert witness supplies
  the matching `c log N` lower, so the generic Gram triangular loss is sharp
  `Theta(log N)`.  The linearized threshold is
  `(1+log N)||H_N||<1`; the exact nonlinear Cholesky off-diagonal relation is
  `L=-L_-[H+LH+HL^*+LL^*+LHL^*]`.
- The nonlinear identity was checked with exact rational finite-matrix algebra;
  this does not claim nonlinear contraction.  Global positivity, positive
  infinite backward towers, backward OU divisibility, and `FS_3` remain OPEN.
- Added `flat_shadow_triangular_stability_r93/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_triangular_stability_r93/audit_r93.js`.  Audit output:
  `R93_TAIL_CONSTANTS_AND_FACTORIAL_DECAY_PASSED`,
  `R93_WEIGHT_RATIO_AND_COLUMN_VANISHING_ANCHORS_PASSED`,
  `R93_FINITE_STRICT_RESOLVENT_PASSED`,
  `R93_NONLINEAR_GRAM_IDENTITY_PASSED`,
  `R93_SHIFT_NO_GO_AND_FOURIER_SELECTOR_PASSED`, and
  `R93_TRIANGULAR_STABILITY_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.

## R94 — Finite-horizon nonlinear Gram stability (2026-09-07)

- R94 rechecked R93's weighted Volterra argument and supplied an explicit
  horizon-uniform finite-section bound.  If
  `epsilon_J=sup_(j>=J)kappa_j` and `|lambda|epsilon_J<=1/2`, then
  `sup_n||(I-lambda P_nKP_n)^(-1)||` is at most
  `max(2,(1+2|lambda|C_K)sum_(q=0)^(J-1)(|lambda|C_K)^q)`.  The same proof gives
  `sigma(K)={0}` by taking `lambda=1/mu` for each `mu!=0`; boundedness of `K`
  is supplied by R92's column bound.
- The main new result is a genuine finite-horizon nonlinear Gram theorem.  For
  Hermitian `H`, `Lambda_N=1+log N`, and
  `||H||<=1/[64 Lambda_N^2]`, the map
  `Phi_H(L)=-L_-[H+LH+HL^*+LL^*+LHL^*]` is a contraction on
  `||L||<=2Lambda_N||H||`.  The exact self-map and Lipschitz constants are
  `1153/1024<2` and `97/1024<1`, respectively.  It yields a unique strict
  lower `L`, `||L||<=2Lambda_N||H||`, and positive diagonalization
  `CGC^*` with explicit two-sided conditioning.
- The Hermitian hypothesis was made explicit in the local record: without
  `H=H^*`, the positive Gram conclusion is not justified, even though the
  contraction estimates themselves are algebraically valid.
- Generic operator-norm stability cannot be made dimension-free.  The
  Hermitian discrete Hilbert witness `H=i/(j-k)` has bounded full norm but
  strict-lower norm `>=c log N`, so the derivative of the Cholesky solution map
  has the same lower growth.  Positivity of `LL^*` alone cannot cancel it.
- The next structural target is a dimension-free triangular estimate for actual
  Hermite Gram compressions; this is conditional/open.  The finite-horizon
  theorem does not prove global positivity, a positive infinite backward tower,
  backward OU divisibility, or `FS_3`.
- Added `flat_shadow_nonlinear_gram_r94/README.md` and
  `flat_shadow_nonlinear_gram_r94/audit_r94.js`.  Audit output:
  `R94_CONTRACTION_CONSTANTS_PASSED`,
  `R94_FINITE_RESOLVENT_ANCHOR_PASSED`,
  `R94_HERMITIAN_WITNESS_ANCHOR_PASSED`, and
  `R94_NONLINEAR_GRAM_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.

## R95 — Hermite gap-Wiener algebra and actual multiplier obstruction

- R95 audited the exact normalized Hermite multiplication matrix.  With
  `e_k=H_k/sqrt(k!)` and `eta_m=L_h[e_m]`,
  `Hcal_n(h)_(ij)=sum_r r! binom(i,r)binom(j,r)
  sqrt((i+j-2r)!/(i!j!)) eta_(i+j-2r)`.  The equivalent `m`-parameter form
  exposes the exact triangle and parity constraints.  The bivariate identity
  is `sum Hcal(h)_(ij) z^i/sqrt(i!) w^j/sqrt(j!)=exp(zw)F_h(z+w)`.
- Introduced the finite degree-gap norm
  `||A||_(W_n)=sum_d||Delta_d A||_op`.  Fourier diagonal extraction gives the
  exact convolution law, submultiplicativity, adjoint invariance, and
  `L_-` contractivity in this norm.
- Combining this algebra with the R77 audited bound
  `||P_nM_(e_m)P_n||<=2^m(3n)^(m/2)/sqrt(m!)` and `rho_n=4sqrt(n)` gives the
  horizon-uniform estimates
  `||Hcal_n(h)||_(W_n)<=189/64 ||h||_(rho_n)` and
  `||L_-Hcal_n(h)||_op<=27sqrt(3)/32 ||h||_(rho_n)`.
- The same R94 nonlinear off-diagonal map therefore contracts in `W_n` when
  `||H||_(W_n)<=1/64`, with `||L||_(W_n)<=2||H||_(W_n)` and positive diagonal
  factorization, uniformly in `n`.  This is a genuine structured replacement
  for the generic `1/log^2 n` finite-horizon condition.
- The structured theorem is not valid for all bounded multipliers.  The actual
  bounded odd multiplier `sgn(x)` has an exact OU Green formula for its odd-even
  Hermite matrix entries; a signed even input block yields a `c log n` lower
  bound, while R94 gives the matching `O(log n)` upper.  Thus parity and
  bounded Gram compression alone do not imply gap summability.
- State boundary: **PROVED** for the exact formula, gap algebra, growing-radius
  structured theorem, nonlinear `W_n` factorization, and actual `sgn` no-go;
  **CONDITIONAL** for applying it to `g1,g2` and the hybrid map; **OPEN** for
  the two concrete background gap-Wiener bounds, fixed-parameter global
  positivity, positive infinite backward tower, backward OU divisibility, and
  `FS_3`.
- Added `flat_shadow_hermite_gap_wiener_r95/README.md` and
  `audit_r95.js`.  Audit output:
  `R95_HERMITE_ENTRY_AND_LOCALITY_PASSED`,
  `R95_GAP_CONVOLUTION_IDENTITY_PASSED`,
  `R95_STRUCTURED_CONSTANTS_PASSED`,
  `R95_TANGENT_MOMENT_NORMALIZATION_PASSED`,
  `R95_SIGN_GREEN_IDENTITY_ANCHORS_PASSED`,
  `R95_SIGN_LOWER_CONSTRUCTION_ANCHOR_PASSED`, and
  `R95_HERMITE_GAP_WIENER_AUDIT_COMPLETED`.

## R96 — actual background gap obstruction and endpoint-safe quadratic bound (2026-09-07)

- R96 先读取 R95 本机记录并回查 R71/R79/R80/R82/R83。由 R71 的 Gaussian-mixture
  tangent representation 和 R95 双变量恒等式，得到 `g1` 每条 gap 的 exact
  coefficient-extraction formula；没有把 entrywise decay 偷换成 operator-norm
  gap summability。
- R82/R83 的 canonical Jacobi tangent closed form 与直接 Hermite multiplier
  entries 对齐：gap one 除 `A_(2,1)=1/sqrt(2)` 外消失；gap `2a+3` 的 entries
  是显式 factorial ratio。取 `k=a(a+1)` 得每条 gap 的 `c/(a+1)` lower，
  配对 factorials 得 `C/(a+1)` upper。因此实际项目 tangent 满足
  `||Hcal_n(g1)||_(W_n)=Theta(log(n+2))`，严格否定
  `sup_n||Hcal_n(g1)||_(W_n)<infinity`。这是实际 `g1` 障碍，不是 `sgn` 的替代反例。
- 对 R80 quadratic `g2`，保留 `alpha=6q_tau(Aq_s+Bq_u)` 的端点几何和四项
  `R^6/R^8/R^10/R^12` 组合，得到 exact gap operator formula。整体 endpoint
  cancellation 为 `|w|alpha^(-3)=q_sq_uA^(3/2)B^(3/2)/(Aq_s+Bq_u)^3`，
  所有 `q_tau^3` 消失，遂有 `sup_(n,d)||Delta_d Hcal_n(g2)||<=M2=4C_R80`。
  但 `sum_d` 尚未控制；`g2` 真实 gap-Wiener growth 仍 OPEN。
- 因 `A_n` 只占 odd gaps、`B_n^(2)` 只占 even gaps，固定非零 `a` 的 uncentered
  background 必然携带 `|a|log n` 的 `W_n` 增长。R95 小球必须改为
  background-centered：先分解 `G_(0,n)=I+aA_n+a^2B_n^(2)`，再研究
  `C_(0,n)H_resC_(0,n)^*` 的 structured bound。
- exact hybrid mismatch 也落地为
  `||o||_(rho_n)=4sqrt(n)sum_j n^jw_j|Z_j|`；`ell^1(w)` 与 growing-radius
  ball 不存在 uniform embedding。候选 hybrid weight
  `v_(n,j)=w_j+gamma_(n,j)` 及其 weighted-column criterion 已写明；含
  `gamma` 的 feedback 仍 OPEN。
- Added `flat_shadow_background_gap_r96/README.md` and `audit_r96.py`.  The
  exact local audit target is `R96_BACKGROUND_GAP_AUDIT_COMPLETED`; no determinant,
  optimizer, SDP, parameter sweep, or remote computation is used。

## R97 — background-centered finite-horizon factorization (2026-09-07)

- 在不使用 determinant 的前提下，补齐了 finite LDL/Cholesky recursion：对
  `G=I+H=G^*`、`||H||op<=h<1`，递归构造 `G=TDT^*` 与 `C=T^{-1}`，并严格得到
  `CGC^*=D`、`1-h<=D_ii<=1+h` 以及
  `||C||op^2,||C^{-1}||op^2<=(1+h)/(1-h)`。因此正式背景
  `I+aA_n+a^2B_n^(2)` 在 `|a|M_1+a^2M_2<1` 下具有 horizon-independent
  operator conditioning。
- 发现并记录一个可用的替代定理：虽然 `W_n` conjugation 不能从 operator
  positivity 推出，但 trace norm 满足
  `||C_(0,n)H C_(0,n)^*||_1<=kappa(h_0)||H||_1`；归一化到 `D_(0,n)` 后系数为
  `beta(h_0)=(1+h_0)/(1-h_0)^2`。故在
  `beta(h_0)||H||_1<=1/[64(1+log N)^2]` 时，R94 给出显式 finite-horizon
  strict-lower contraction，收缩因子 `97/1024`。
- 对 `G_n(a)=I+aA_n` 在 `a=0` 微分，严格下三角方程给出
  `C_n'(0)=-L_-A_n`。结合 R96 实际 `g1` 的 harmonic gap lower，得到
  `sup_n||C_n'(0)||_(W_n)=infinity`。这否定的是 dimension-free `W_n`
  background local-Lipschitz 方案，而不是未经证明地声称固定非零参数下的
  全部 conjugation 发散。
- 新增 `flat_shadow_background_centered_r97/README.md` 与 `audit_r97.py`。
  本机审计通过：`R97_EXACT_LDL_RECURSION_PASSED`、
  `R97_CONDITIONING_AND_CONTRACTION_CONSTANTS_PASSED`、
  `R97_LINEARIZED_TRIANGULAR_NO_GO_ANCHOR_PASSED`、
  `R97_BACKGROUND_CENTERED_AUDIT_COMPLETED`；并复跑 R95/R96 审计通过。
- 状态边界：上述 finite factorization、operator conditioning、trace-norm
  substitute 与实际 `g1` linearized no-go 为 PROVED；将 trace residual bound
  施加到完整 branch 为 CONDITIONAL；uniform background-centered `W_n`
  comparison、`g2` gap sum、hybrid feedback、global positivity、positive
  infinite tower、backward OU divisibility、`FS_3` 仍 OPEN。

## R97 网页端强化记录：relative Jacobi geometry 与 quadratic growing-gap（2026-09-07）

网页端在上述本机 R97 摘要基础上补出了主路线所需的更强结构；本机只核验有限
递归、交换子代数与 min-envelope 求和，不把端点 `C_2(g_2)<infinity` 的全部解析
常数冒称为独立机器证明。

- 对 `w_a=1+a g_1+a^2g_2`、`delta_a=|a|M_1+a^2M_2<1`，在
  `d mu_a=w_a d gamma` 下做 exact monic Gram--Schmidt：
  `u_k=-(G_0^[k-1])^(-1)b_k`、`phi_k=e_k+sum_(j<k)(u_k)_j e_j`、
  `C_0G_0C_0^*=D_0`，并得到 `1-delta_a<=D_0<=1+delta_a` 与 horizon-uniform
  operator conditioning。没有使用 determinant。
- 正确的 centered residual 是
  `bar E=S_0 Hcal_n(h)S_0^*`，其中 `S_0=D_0^(-1/2)C_0`；在有限 horizon 上，
  `h/w_a` 可由 `p_(a,n)[h]=Pi_(<=2n)^(mu_a)(h^[2n]/w_a)` 精确替换。若
  `p_(a,n)[h]=sum b_m x^m`，背景 Jacobi 矩阵给出
  `P_(a,n)(h)=sum|b_m|[6 sqrt(kappa_a) sqrt(3n+1)]^m` 以及
  `||bar E_n||_(W_n)<=P_(a,n)(h)`。
- 因而 `P_(a,n)(h)<=1/64` 时，normalized centered equation 的 contraction 常数
  仍为 `97/1024<1`，`||tilde L_n||_(W_n)<=2P_(a,n)(h)`；返回原单项式归一化时
  `||L_n||_(W_n)<=2 sqrt(kappa_a)P_(a,n)(h)`。若 `sup_nP_(a,n)(h(a))<=1/64`，
  则 fixed nonzero `a` 的 all-degree Gram positivity 成为 conditional theorem。
- 对 `g_2`，精确二阶 number-operator commutator 给出
  `||Delta_d B_n^(2)||<=min{M_2,C_2(g_2)(n+1)/d^2}`。R80 端点的
  `alpha^(-3)` 与 signed weight 的精确抵消被保留，因此 proportional gaps 的尾部
  uniform bounded；min-envelope 求和进一步给出
  `||B_n^(2)||_(W_n)<=3M_2+4 sqrt(M_2 C_2(g_2)(n+1))=O(sqrt n)`，严格优于
  R96 的 `O(n)`，但仍不足以决定 `O(1)`、`Theta(log n)` 或其他次线性增长。
- hybrid transfer 的正确新增量是
  `Gamma_(a,n,j)=P_(a,n)(h^(j))`、`v_(a,n,j)=w_j+Gamma_(a,n,j)`，以及
  `C_Gamma(a)=sup_(n,j)Gamma_(a,n,j)^(-1)sum_kGamma_(a,n,k)|K_(k,j)^(n)|`。
  R92/R93 的 `C_w` 已证；若 `C_Gamma(a)<infinity`，则 hybrid column norm 不超过
  `max(C_w,C_Gamma(a))`。`C_Gamma`、relative nonlinear invariance、`g_2`
  mesoscopic envelope、global positivity、positive backward tower、backward OU
  divisibility 与 `FS_3` 仍 OPEN。

本段对应网页 R97 的实际强化结论；本机审计目标仍为
`R97_BACKGROUND_CENTERED_AUDIT_COMPLETED`，并应复跑 R95/R96 审计以确认记录未破坏既有
精确核验链。

## R98 本机先行结果：原始 growing-radius Γ hybrid 的严格 endpoint no-go（2026-09-07）

- R97 的候选 `Gamma_(a,n,j)=P_(a,n)(h^(j))` 在 `a=0` 可完全写出：
  `h^(j)=c_j e_(2j+1)`、`c_j=(j!)^2/(2j+1)!`，
  `Gamma_(0,n,j)=c_j A_(2j+1)(R_n)`，`R_n=6sqrt(3n+1)`，其中 `A_m` 是
  Hermite 多项式绝对 monomial coefficient sum。
- 对固定 `D`，`Gamma_(0,n,j+D)/Gamma_(0,n,j)` 的最高次项给出精确渐近
  `const_(j,D) R_n^(2D)`。这说明 growing-radius cost 对低阶输入与高阶输出的
  比值本身携带 horizon 幂次。
- R82 actual canonical mixed kernel 的 exact gap-four channel 在 `j=1` 为
  `K_(5,1)=-271/3600`，且 finite section 达到该输出后不再依赖 `n`。因此
  `C_Gamma(0)>=|K_(5,1)|Gamma_(0,n,5)/Gamma_(0,n,1)~const R_n^8`，从而
  `C_Gamma(0)=infinity`。
- 这严格否定“用原始 `Gamma` 在含 Gaussian endpoint 的小 `a` 邻域统一传递”。
  它不否定 R92/R93 的 `ell^1(w)` closure，因为两者的 norm scaling 不同。
  后续必须采用 `R_n^(-(2j+1))Gamma_(a,n,j)` 型 renormalization 或 degree-local
  background/Jacobi cost，再重新检查 mixed feedback 与 centered equation。
- 新增 `flat_shadow_hybrid_transfer_obstruction_r98/README.md` 与
  `audit_r98.py`。状态边界：`C_Gamma(0)=infinity` 为 PROVED；fixed nonzero `a`
  的 projected higher-degree behavior、替代 norm 的 column bound、nonlinear
  hybrid invariance、global positivity、positive backward tower、backward OU
  divisibility 与 `FS_3` 仍 OPEN。

## R98 强化：Gaussian endpoint 的 renormalized hybrid column（2026-09-07）

- 对原始 `Gamma_(0,n,j)` 除以其 mode degree 对应的
  `R_n^(2j+1)`，定义 `GammaHat_(0,n,j)`。由正系数 Hermite 递归和
  `2n/R_n^2<1/54`，得到显式 `rho_*=3025/5832<1` 及
  `GammaHat_(0,n,j+D)/GammaHat_(0,n,j)<=rho_*^D`。
- 因而 R97 的 Gaussian-endpoint `R_n^(2D)` no-go 可以被精确修复：在
  `n>=k+1` 的 interior columns 上，R91 的 mesoscopic estimate 与 R92 的
  factorial all-gap estimate 结合后给出
  `sup_(n,j>=1)sum_(k=j+3)^(n-1)|K_(k,j)^(n)|
  GammaHat_(0,n,k)/GammaHat_(0,n,j)<infinity`。
- 这个结果只证明了 renormalized linear mixed transfer 的 endpoint 小定理；
  fixed nonzero `a` 的 relative projection、horizon boundary、centered nonlinear
  invariance、global positivity、positive backward tower、backward OU divisibility
  与 `FS_3` 继续 OPEN。
- R98 审计新增 `R98_RENORMALIZED_ENDPOINT_COLUMN_MAJORANT_PASSED`；不引入
  determinant、optimizer、SDP、扫描或新的 gate。

## R98 方法学边界：固定阶 commutator 不能突破 (g_2) 的 √(n)（2026-09-07）

- 若固定阶 `r` 的 number-operator commutator 只给出
  `C_r(n+1)^(r/2)/d^r`，与 per-gap `M_2` 合并后的交叉尺度恒为
  `d~sqrt(n)`，总和恒为 `O(sqrt(n))`；恒等式是
  `r/2+(1-r)/2=1/2`。
- 因此“继续升高交换子阶数”被严格识别为 method barrier，而不是 `g_2`
  的增长结论。必须利用 R80 四项 block 的低 gap cancellation、有限差分或
  可求和 two-parameter envelope。
- R98 审计新增 `R98_FINITE_COMMUTATOR_SQRTN_BARRIER_PASSED`；高阶端点常数
  `C_r` 本身仍未假定有限。

## R98 实际 `g2` 的 exact gap-6 lower anchor（2026-09-07）

- 从 R71 的 `U(z)=z^3/6+O(z^5)` 和 R80 的二阶方程 `A V=-B`，得到
  `[z^6]B=C_(3,3)/36`。对
  `r_j=sqrt(2/3)cos(theta+2pi(j-1)/3)`，精确角向恒等式给出
  `C_(3,3)=-7/72`，而 `A_(6)=5/18`。
- 因此 `[z^6]V=7/720`，实际 `g2` 的 normalized Hermite moment 为
  `eta_6=7sqrt(5)/60`。由于 `e_6e_0=e_6`，对 `n>=6` 有
  `||Delta_6 B_n^(2)||>=7sqrt(5)/60`，并由 Hermitian symmetry 得
  `||B_n^(2)||_(W_n)>=7sqrt(5)/30`。
- 这是 actual R80 `g2` 的严格 nonzero gap anchor，不是增长率结论；它排除
  了“所有 even gaps 被四项结构消掉”的错误猜想。`O(1)`、`Theta(log n)` 或更大
  的 mesoscopic summability 仍 OPEN。审计新增
  `R98_G2_GAP6_ANCHOR_PASSED`。
- 更精确地，最低 degree-six Hermite mode 给出完整 boundary corner：当
  `i+j=6` 时，`(B_n^(2))_(i,6-i)=eta_6 sqrt(binomial(6,i))`。因此 gaps
  `6,4,2,0` 的首个 boundary entries 分别为
  `eta_6,sqrt(6)eta_6,sqrt(15)eta_6,sqrt(20)eta_6`。这是 finite-degree
  corner certificate，而不是 mesoscopic growth conclusion；审计新增
  `R98_G2_DEGREE6_CORNER_PASSED`。

# 2026-09-07 — R99 positive backward-OU Hermite cone

- 本轮没有把正性停留在抽象口号，而是对 genuine backward pair `g=P_t h`
  写出 exact finite Gram cone。若 `a_m(g)=E_g[He_m/sqrt(m!)]`，则每个
  `M_t(g)=[E_h(psi_i psi_j)]` 都是 PSD，其条目由 Hermite product formula
  精确给出；对 `L^2(gamma)` 正密度实际为正定。该结论直接使用了 positive
  preimage，不是 operator-only 例子。
- `(0,m)` principal minor 给出高阶 cone wall
  `a_m^2 <= sum_ell c_(m,ell)t^ell a_(2m-2ell)`，其中
  `c_(m,ell)=m!sqrt((2m-2ell)!)/(ell!(m-ell)!^2)`。这是可反复代入
  same-factor exact-zero 关系的统一接口。
- centered variance-one 下，`[psi_1,psi_2]` block 给出严格 skew/kurtosis
  墙 `a_4>(3t^(-1)a_3^2-t^2)/sqrt(6)`，等价于
  `m_3^2<t(m_4-3+2t^2)`；`[psi_0,psi_3]` block 给出独立 sixth-order
  墙 `a_3^2<2sqrt(5)a_6+3sqrt(6)t a_4+t^3`。
- 对 depth-`N` fixed-factor tower 令 `t=q^N`，得到
  `a_4(g^(0))>-q^(2N)/sqrt(6)`；若 `a_4(g^(0))<=0`，则
  `|a_3(g^(0))|<q^(3N/2)/sqrt(3)`。这是一个 genuine quantitative local
  theorem，但 third Hermite moment 与 `P_3K` charge 尚未桥接。
- 新增 `positive_backward_hermite_cone_r99/README.md` 与 `audit_r99.py`。
  本机 exact audit 通过 `R99_HERMITE_PRODUCT_FORMULA_PASSED`、
  `R99_POSITIVE_BACKWARD_GRAM_CONE_PASSED`、
  `R99_DEGREE34_SKEW_KURTOSIS_WALL_PASSED`、
  `R99_DEGREE36_SIXTH_ORDER_WALL_PASSED`、
  `R99_DEPTH_N_SPECIALIZATION_PASSED`、
  `R99_POSITIVE_BACKWARD_HERMITE_CONE_AUDIT_COMPLETED`。
- 证据边界：没有推出 Gaussian rigidity、`P_3K` charge-to-cone bridge、
  mesoscopic tail 或 fixed nonzero branch closure；这些继续 OPEN。下一轮应
  从 same-factor exact-zero identity 提取 `a_3,a_4,a_6` 关系并代入 R99 cone，
  而不是继续无结构地增加 radial 系数展开。

# 2026-09-07 — R100 finite-depth certificate from the positive cone

- 将 R99 的 `(0,m)` cone wall 定义为
  `F_m(t;g)=sum_ell c_(m,ell)t^ell a_(2m-2ell)(g)-a_m(g)^2`。正的
  backward preimage 必须满足严格 `F_m(t;g)>0`；因此 `F_m(q^N;g^(0))<=0`
  是排除 depth-`N` positive preimage 的 exact finite certificate。
- `[psi_1,psi_2]` Schur complement 化为
  `f_(3,4)(t)=t^3+sqrt(6)a_4t-3a_3^2>0`。当 `a_3!=0` 时它有唯一正根
  `tau_(3,4)`，故任何 positive preimage 都满足 `t>tau_(3,4)`；固定因子
  tower 满足 `q^N>tau_(3,4)`，从而得到显式最大深度界。`a_3=0,a_4<0`
  时阈值是 `sqrt(-sqrt(6)a_4)`。
- 这把“charge-to-cone”缺口具体化为可证目标：若 exact same-factor zero
  identity 能迫使 `P_3K` 触发某个 `F_m` 违例或统一正深度阈值，则可关闭
  相应 tower 子类；目前高阶/角向 charge 与一维 moments 的桥仍 OPEN。
- 新增 `positive_backward_hermite_cone_r100/README.md` 与 `audit_r100.py`。
  本机 exact audit 将核验 `R100_SKEW_KURTOSIS_POLYNOMIAL_PASSED`、
  `R100_SIXTH_ORDER_FEASIBILITY_WALL_PASSED`、`R100_UNIQUE_ROOT_ALGEBRA_PASSED`、
  `R100_DEPTH_SUBSTITUTION_PASSED`、`R100_FINITE_DEPTH_CERTIFICATE_AUDIT_COMPLETED`。

# 2026-09-07 — R101 Angular Herglotz charge cone

- 网页端本轮沿 `Charge–Cone Shape Rigidity` 完成了真正的非局部推进：对 genuine
  full-exact three-copy law 的 angular family `mu_theta`，characteristic identity
  给出 Gaussian barycenter；其 Fourier signed measures `nu_r` 满足
  `|nu_r|<=gamma`，从而得到 pointwise infinite Toeplitz/Herglotz cone
  `[chi_(p-q)(x)]>=0`。这里使用真实概率测度正性，没有把 formal Fock 系数当作
  概率结论。
- Hermite addition law 给出完整 same-factor cubic charge map `beta_(m,r)`，选择律为
  `m>=3|r|` 且 `m=r mod 2`。Parseval 得到全阶概率锥
  `sum t^(-m)|beta_(m,r)(g)|^2<=1`，其中 `g=P_t h` 且 preimage 也属 genuine
  exact class。`r=1` 的 degree 3/5/7/9 公式已由本机 exact symbolic audit 核验，
  degree 9 首次显示 nonlinear mixing。
- 若 law moment-determinate，首个非零 odd Hermite mode `a_d` 给出
  `beta_(d,1)=Lambda_d a_d`、`Lambda_d>0`，所以 `chi_1=0` 当且仅当 law 对称。
  结合全阶 backward cone，任何 asymmetric genuine exact fixed base 的正向 OU
  backward depth 必有限；这不要求 `a_3!=0`，是可独立报告的弱定理。
- 严格边界：R101 没有把 `P_3K` 识别成 `chi_1`，没有给 varying-bottom sequence
  的 uniform charge noncollapse，也没有关闭 symmetric even sector。因此
  `P_3K` bridge 与完整 Positive Backward-Tower Exact Zero-Set Rigidity 仍 OPEN。
  若 `RK=1` 到 genuine full-exact law 的识别尚未独立完成，则 moment/measure 部分
  对 bare scalar `RK=1` 只能记为 CONDITIONAL。
- 新增 `angular_charge_cone_r101/README.md`、`audit_r101.py`。审计通过：
  `R101_D3_GEOMETRY_AND_SELECTION_RULES_PASSED`、
  `R101_CHARGE_MAP_DEGREE_3_5_7_9_PASSED`、
  `R101_FIRST_ODD_MODE_AND_OU_SCALING_PASSED`、
  `R101_ANGULAR_HERGLOTZ_CHARGE_CONE_AUDIT_COMPLETED`。

# 2026-09-07 — R101 connector-history definition audit

- 在发送 R102 前，对当前内置网页端数学对话的已加载历史进行了定义级检索；
  历史文本明确把 `P_3K` 称为 nonlinear log-density charge，并明确保留它
  与 `chi_1`、`beta_(m,1)` 的逻辑区分。
- 在该已加载历史中没有找到可直接核验的 `P_3K` 原始公式、投影定义或
  reflection/OU transformation law；因此不能把“对称性蕴含 `P_3K=0`”写成
  已证结论，也不能用网页端的描述替代定义。此条是 connector-history 的
  前置审计事实，不是对整个项目资料不存在该定义的全局断言。
- R102 的唯一任务因此保持为：从项目原始定义回溯 `P_3K`，先完成定义和
  变换律审计，再决定是否存在 `chi_1` zero-set bridge；不得重复 R99/R100
  的低阶 cone，也不得猜测或偷换符号。

# 2026-09-07 — R102 log-cumulant charge symmetry audit

- 网页端从早期 R4 angular MGF 记号恢复了定义级接口：
  `mathscr K_mu(z,theta)=sum_j K_mu(z*a_j(theta))-z^2/2`，其中
  `K_mu=log M_mu`、`a_j=sqrt(2/3)cos(theta+2*pi*(j-1)/3)`；complex
  harmonic-3 projection 定义为
  `P_3K=(1/(2*pi))*int exp(-3*i*theta)*mathscr K_mu dtheta`。完整 cosine
  convention 只差一个 factor two。
- D3 root-filter 的 exact cumulant formula 是
  `P_3K(mu;z)=sum_(m>=3, odd) Lambda_m*kappa_m*z^m/m!`，
  `Lambda_m=3*(sqrt(2/3)/2)^m*binomial(m,(m-3)/2)>0`。这说明它检测
  所有 odd cumulants，而非仅 `a_3`。
- 本机新增 `log_cumulant_charge_r102/README.md` 与 `audit_r102.py`，并修正
  一处首次运行时发现的 Laurent coefficient index 错误。最终 exact audit
  通过：`R102_D3_GEOMETRY_AND_LAMBDA_CONSTANTS_PASSED`、
  `R102_EXACT_CUMULANT_PROJECTION_PASSED`、
  `R102_REFLECTION_AND_OU_COVARIANCE_PASSED`、
  `R102_FIRST_ODD_SECTOR_BETA_COMPARISON_PASSED`、
  `R102_LOG_CUMULANT_CHARGE_AUDIT_COMPLETED`；R101 回归审计也通过。
- 定义级结论：反射下 `P_3K(check(mu))=-P_3K(mu)`，OU 下
  `P_3K(P_t mu)(z)=P_3K(mu)(sqrt(t)z)`。在局部 MGF 唯一性下，
  `P_3K==0 iff mu symmetric`；在 R101 genuine full-exact,
  moment-determinate class 内，结合 `chi_1==0 iff mu symmetric`，得到
  `P_3K==0 iff chi_1==0`。二者仍是不同 observable，只有首个非零 odd sector
  的系数满足 `[z^d]P_3K=beta_(d,1)/sqrt(d!)`。
- 重要路线重估：如果任一 asymmetric genuine full-exact law `h` 存在，则
  `g_N^(j)=P_(q^(N-j))h` 是任意深 positive exact tower，底层趋近 Gaussian，
  且 `P_3K` 作为 analytic germ 对每个有限 N 保持非零。于是 varying-bottom
  tower 的 existence 与 asymmetric genuine exact-law existence 等价；不能
  追求未经 OU 归一化的 depth-independent charge amplitude lower bound。真正
  的终局变成排除 asymmetric genuine exact law，或证明 primitive OU-invariant
  shape quantity 的 uniform gap。
- 证据边界：R102 有限代数与变换律已 PROVED / locally audited；定义的历史
  provenance 由网页端恢复，尚需与早期 R4 原文逐项对照。zero-set bridge 对
  genuine full-exact class 在 analytic/MGF 假设下 PROVED；裸 `RK=1` 转移仍
  CONDITIONAL。asymmetric law exclusion、primitive closure、even sector 和
  final positive backward-tower rigidity 继续 OPEN。

# 2026-09-07 — R103 asymmetric genuine exact-law exclusion: all-degree tax and obstruction

- 网页端 R103 沿固定 `z` 的 Herglotz/Toeplitz positivity、
  `<exp(mathscr K)>=1` 与 iid same-factor cubic factorization 三者共同推进。
  本机新增 `asymmetric_exact_exclusion_r103/README.md`、`audit_r103.py`。
- R103-A/B：对 `w_z=exp(mathscr K)`、`c_r=<exp(-3irtheta)w_z>`、
  `R=<mathscr K>`，exact Jensen/Szegő predictor 给出
  `exp(R)<=1-c_1^2`，并以 `b=c_2-c_1^2` 给出
  `exp(R)<=1-c_1^2-b^2`（小实 `z`）。Poisson kernel 取一阶等号，故这些
  只是 sharp 的 radial compensation bound，不能单独排除 asymmetry。
- R103-C：若 `d` 是首个非零 odd cumulant，same-factor exactness 清空
  `4<=m<2d` 的 even cumulants，并强制
  `kappa_(2d)=-(2d)!/(2(d!)^2)*<p_d^2>/<p_(2d)>*kappa_d^2<0`。
  对 `q_r=[z^d]Q_r` 有全角向能量恒等式
  `-[z^(2d)]R=sum_(r:3r<=d,r odd)|q_r|^2`；`T_d>1` 从 `d>=9` 开始。
- 对 `d=3,5,7`，第二 Herglotz predictor 仍产生
  `[z^(2d)]Q_2=-eta_d q_1^2`，`eta_d=1/20,5/28,7/24`。这补上了仅用
  `P_3K` 或 `c_1` 看不到的 higher-charge tax。
- 明确 non-genuine 障碍：`h_0=sin(x)-(exp(3/2)/2)sin(2x)`、
  `f_theta=1+2epsilon*h_0*cos(3theta)` 是真实 positive centered
  variance-one D3/reflection family，具有 Gaussian barycenter、完整
  Herglotz cone 与 `<exp(mathscr K)>=1`，但 degree-6 的 `Q_2/R` 比为 `1/2`，
  genuine same-factor fingerprint 必须为 `1/20`，因而六阶精确排除。
  这是 nonfactorization obstruction，不是 genuine counterexample。
- formal same-factor jet `kappa_3=epsilon,kappa_6=-3epsilon^2` 在六阶仍可
  满足 exact barycenter identity，说明有限 cumulant order 与有限 positivity
  minor 原则上不足以完成 exclusion。真正缺口是 all-degree
  Schur/Herglotz coherence 与 one-body probability realization。
- 审计通过：`R103_PREDICTOR_ALGEBRA_PASSED`、
  `R103_FIRST_ODD_ALL_CHARGE_ENERGY_PASSED`、
  `R103_HIGHER_CHARGE_TAX_AND_ETA_PASSED`、
  `R103_EXPLICIT_NONFACTORIZATION_OBSTRUCTION_PASSED`、

  `R103_ASYMMETRIC_EXCLUSION_AUDIT_COMPLETED`；R101/R102 regression 与
  `git diff --check` 均通过。
- 证据边界：R103 仍未证明 asymmetric genuine full-exact law 不存在；
  `RK=1` 到 genuine full-exact identification 仍 CONDITIONAL。下一轮目标为
  infinite Schur-cumulant cascade，不再增加孤立低阶 minors。

# 2026-09-07 — R104 Infinite Schur–Cumulant Cascade

- 网页端 R104 完成了此前指定的全阶主线：固定实 `z` 时，把
  `w_z(theta)=exp(mathscr K(z,theta))` 经 `phi=3theta` 视为单位圆上的严格正
  权，并以 OPUC/Gram–Schmidt 定义 reflection/Schur 参数 `alpha_n(z)`。首两级
  精确为 `alpha_0=c_1`、`alpha_1=(c_2-c_1^2)/(1-c_1^2)`，预测误差满足
  `E_(n+1)=E_n(1-alpha_n^2)`。
- 严格正连续权下，Szegő 预测极限给出 exact infinite budget
  `exp(R)=prod_n(1-alpha_n^2)`，即
  `S=sum_n -log(1-alpha_n^2)=-R`。这把 R103 的有限 predictor 统一成了
  一个全阶 identity；网页端同时正确区分了 analytic theorem 与 formal
  coefficientwise completion。
- 同因子 D3 结构给出 Schur locality/parity：
  `alpha_(r-1)=O(z^(3r))`、`alpha_(r-1)(-z)=(-1)^r alpha_(r-1)(z)`；首个非零
  odd cumulant `kappa_d` 会同时激活所有 admissible first Schur charges，
  `[z^d]alpha_(r-1)=Lambda_(d,r)kappa_d/d!`。R103 的 first-odd all-charge
  energy identity 正是 `S=-R` 的首个 `z^(2d)` 系数。
- 令 `A_(2N)=3*binom(2N,N)/6^N`，得到 forced-even 的有限 grade 递归
  `kappa_(2N)=-(2N)!/A_(2N) [z^(2N)]S`，且该阶只使用
  `r<=floor(N/3)` 的 Schur charges。它为 even cumulant 的强制性提供了新的
  prediction-loss 解释，但没有声称单靠形式递归能排除 odd branch。
- 新的全局接口是 Schur–Abel reconstruction。若 `K_e=(K(r)+K(-r))/2`、
  `rho=sqrt(2/3)`，则
  `A K_e(r)=r^2/4-S(r/rho)/3`，并有
  `K_e(r)=r^2/2-J(r)/3`，其中
  `J(r)=d/dr int_0^r s*S(s/rho)/sqrt(r^2-s^2) ds`。genuine probability
  CGF 强制 `J<=3r^2/2` 与 `J''<=3`。这是把 one-body realization 变成两个
  可检验全局实轴约束的弱定理接口。
- 本机新增 `infinite_schur_cumulant_r104/README.md`、`audit_r104.py`。最终
  exact symbolic audit 通过：
  `R104_D3_GEOMETRY_AND_HARMONIC_WEIGHTS_PASSED`、
  `R104_FORCED_EVEN_RECURSION_AND_FINITE_SZEGO_BUDGET_PASSED`、
  `R104_SCHUR_FIRST_STEPS_AND_ABEL_MULTIPLIER_PASSED`、
  `R104_OU_GRADE_AND_FIRST_ODD_SCHUR_VECTOR_PASSED`、
  `R104_INFINITE_SCHUR_CUMULANT_AUDIT_COMPLETED`。
- 证据边界：R104 的严格正连续权 infinite product/Abel reconstruction 为
  **ANALYTICALLY PROVED，LOCAL-AUDITED**；形式 infinite Schur completion 为
  **FORMAL-PROVED**，不能冒充 probability realization；
  `Schur–Abel Convexity Breakdown Lemma`、asymmetric genuine exact-law
  exclusion、symmetric even sector 与最终 backward-tower rigidity 仍
  **OPEN**。bare `RK=1` 识别仍 **CONDITIONAL**。
- 下一轮网页端开始前必须先阅读本机总纲、工作日志、R103/R104 README 与 audit；
  继续主攻 `P_3K!=0` 是否必导致 `J>3r^2/2` 或 `J''>3`，若不能则必须给出
  可严格审计的 genuine Bochner/positive-definiteness 障碍。不得重开 R99–R103，
  不做更多孤立低阶 `alpha_n` 展开，不做数值 sweep、SDP、optimizer 或 remote
  computation。

# 2026-09-07 — R105 Genuine homometric phase obstruction

- 网页端 R105 已完成 R104 指定的 Schur–Abel global real-axis 审查。由
  `K_e=r^2/2-J/3` 与 `K_e=(K(r)+K(-r))/2` 得到
  `J=3r^2/2-(3/2)log(M(r)M(-r))`，并核验
  `3r^2/2-J=(3/2)log(M(r)M(-r))`、
  `3-J''=(3/2)(Var_{mu_r}X+Var_{mu_{-r}}X)` 以及 `J'<3r`。因此
  real-axis convexity-breakdown 不能作为独立中间增益；它与排除非对称
  genuine exact law 处于同一逻辑层级。
- 网页端构造的真实 finite-support homometric pair 已本机 exact audit：
  `mu_sym=(-3/2,0,3/2)` with probabilities `(2/9,5/9,2/9)`，以及
  `mu_asym=(-1,1/2,2)` with probabilities `(4/9,4/9,1/9)`。二者 centered、
  variance-one，三阶矩为 `0` 与 `1/2`，四阶矩均为 `9/4`，且
  `M_sym(r)M_sym(-r)=M_asym(r)M_asym(-r)`。所以 real-axis `J`、difference law
  与 characteristic modulus 不能识别 phase/symmetry；这是 genuine
  probability obstruction，不是 full-exact counterexample。
- 同一审计从 `Z=<exp(mathscr K)>=1` 的四阶系数 `kappa4/48` 核验 full-exact
  必须满足 `kappa4=0`、`m4=3`，故上述 pair 被 exactness 明确排除。
- 新增 `homometric_phase_obstruction_r105/README.md` 与 `audit_r105.py`。
  本机输出：`R105_SCHUR_ABEL_SLACK_IDENTITIES_PASSED`、
  `R105_HOMOMETRIC_BERNOULLI_PAIR_PASSED`、
  `R105_FOURTH_ORDER_EXACTNESS_OBSTRUCTION_PASSED`、
  `R105_HOMOMETRIC_PHASE_OBSTRUCTION_AUDIT_COMPLETED`。
- 路线状态：`Schur–Abel` 已完成 autocorrelation sector；剩余核心转为
  **Exact-Constrained Bochner Phase-Lift Rigidity — OPEN**。网页端提出的
  `<prod_j|phi(a_jy)|> <= exp(-y^2/2)` 只是下一轮子引理，当前 exact identity
  只给出相反的三角不等式方向。`RK=1` 到 genuine full-exact 仍
  **CONDITIONAL**；asymmetric exact-law exclusion、even sector 与最终
  positive backward-tower theorem 仍 **OPEN**。

# 2026-09-07 — R106 Exact-constrained Bochner phase lift

- 网页端先按本机 R105 基线审查了候选反向模长上界。令
  `F_y=prod_j phi(a_j(theta)y)=r_y exp(iV_y)`、`A=<r_y>`、
  `g=exp(-y^2/2)`，以 `r_y/A` 加权后得到 exact phase-defect identity
  `A-g=2A E_pi[sin^2(V_y/2)]>=0`。因此 `A<=g` 在局部等价于 triangle equality
  与 phase alignment，并结合 R102 analytic charge input 等价于 `P_3K=0`/
  对称 branch；它不是独立中间桥。
- 若 hypothetical asymmetric genuine full-exact law 的首个 odd cumulant degree
  是 `d`，R103 all-charge energy `S_d=sum|q_r|^2>0` 给出
  `A/g=1+S_d y^(2d)+O(y^(2d+2))`，且 `S_d=1/2<V_d^2>`。故非零 odd charge
  分支必在小非零轴上产生严格 modulus excess；这是 **CONDITIONAL**，不是已
  构造的 full-exact law。
- 新的 genuine Bochner 接口来自三点 covariance inequality
  `|phi(x+v)-phi(x)phi(v)|^2 <= (1-|phi(x)|^2)(1-|phi(v)|^2)`。代入
  `x=a_1y,v=a_2y` 并平均，令 `psi=|phi|^2`、`rho=sqrt(2/3)`，得到
  `3<psi(rho y cos(theta))> <= 1+2exp(-y^2/2)`，以及
  `0<=A-g<=1/2[1+2A-3<psi(rho y cos(theta))>]`。这是 genuine probability
  必要条件且完全 phase-free；它与 R105 的 difference-law reconstruction
  直接相接。
- 本机新增 `bochner_phase_lift_rigidity_r106/README.md` 与 `audit_r106.py`，
  记录完整证据边界：有限 algebra 为 **PROVED / LOCAL-AUDITED**，等价链与
  首项 asymptotic 依赖 R102–R104 analytic input；非零 odd charge 的 Bochner
  breakdown、asymmetric exact-law exclusion、full phase-lift 与 backward-tower
  rigidity 仍 **OPEN**。下一轮定为 R107 `Difference–Bochner Breakdown Lemma`，
  不重开 R99–R106，不做数值、SDP、optimizer 或 remote computation。

# 2026-09-07 — R107 三点 Bochner genuine obstruction 与四点升级

- 网页端判定 R106 的 `P_3K!=0 =>` 三点 Difference–Bochner breakdown 没有独立
  增益：在 genuine full-exact 类内，三点条件是所有 genuine law 的必要条件，
  因而 breakdown 与 asymmetric exact-law exclusion 同层级。
- 构造 exact-fourth homometric Bernoulli-convolution pair。取 `p(1-p)=1/6`、
  `a=sqrt(3)`、独立 Bernoulli `B_1,B_2`，令
  `X_sym=a(B_1-B_2)`、`X_asym=a(B_1+B_2-2p)`。二者 centered、variance-one、
  `m4=3`，但 `m3=0` 与 `m3=1`，`kappa6=-6`，且
  `M_sym(r)M_sym(-r)=M_asym(r)M_asym(-r)`。所以相同 `psi=|phi|^2` 与
  `difference-law` 不能识别 symmetry；它不是 full-exact counterexample，因为
  exact degree-six fingerprint 要求 `kappa6=-3m3^2`。
- 有限 OU/Gaussian smoothing `X_lambda=sqrt(lambda)X+sqrt(1-lambda)G` 保持
  同 `psi`、`m4=3` 与非对称 charge，给出 `m3=lambda^(3/2)`、
  `kappa6=-6lambda^3`。网页端以 `lambda=0` 的 Bessel/MGF 逐项矩比较、原点
  `((1-lambda^3)/216)y^6` 正首项、紧区间连续性和高斯尾界解析证明：充分小
  `lambda>0` 时三点 Difference–Bochner inequality 对所有实 `y` 仍成立。
- 因此三点 obstruction 已严格钉死；最小自然升级是四点 multiplicative Gram
  `Gamma_4`，即对 `U-u,V-v,UV-w` 的协方差 PSD，新增 companion frequency
  `w=phi((a1-a2)y)`，及其 Schur complement `q^*C^(-1)q<=1-|w|^2`。
  四点足够完成 rigidity 仍 **OPEN**，R108 目标是寻找 angular averaging 后
  不能塌缩为 `psi` 的 signed phase functional。
- 本机新增 `bochner_breakdown_obstruction_r107/README.md` 与 `audit_r107.py`。
  审计通过：`R107_EXACT_FOURTH_HOMOMETRIC_PAIR_PASSED`、
  `R107_OU_CUMULANT_SCALING_AND_DEGREE6_OBSTRUCTION_PASSED`、
  `R107_THREE_POINT_TAYLOR_SLACK_PASSED`、
  `R107_FOUR_POINT_MULTIPLICATIVE_GRAM_SHAPE_PASSED`、
  `R107_BOCHNER_BREAKDOWN_OBSTRUCTION_AUDIT_COMPLETED`。
- 证据边界：上述有限结构为 **PROVED / LOCAL-AUDITED**；充分小平滑参数的
  全局三点不等式为网页端解析证明；它不是主问题反例。asymmetric exact-law
  exclusion、四点 phase rigidity、`RK=1` 识别与最终 backward-tower theorem
  仍 **OPEN**。

# 2026-09-07 — R108 四点 bispectrum separation 与 shear-cocycle interface

- 网页端 R108 完成了 R107 指定的四点 multiplicative Bochner 审查。结论是四点
  层没有塌回 `psi=|phi|^2`，而是第一次留下 genuine bispectrum phase；但最浅
  principal minor 仍只给旧 cone wall `m_3^2<=2`，不能宣布四点已经完成 rigidity。
- 本轮固定 `x=a_1y`、`z=-a_2y`，对 `U-u,V-v,UV-w` 构造精确 `Gamma_4>=0` 与
  Schur complement。取 `s=a_2y`、`t=(a_1-a_2)y` 后，exact identity 重写为
  `<B(s,s+t)>_{E_y}=exp(-y^2/2)`，而 companion principal minor 第一次看到
  `B(s,t)`。
- 定义 `Q_4=Re<B(s,t)>`。R107 同 `psi` homometric pair 的 `kappa_3` 差异和
  `b^(Q)=(-a_1,a_2,a_1-a_2)` 的角向矩给出
  `Q_4,asym-Q_4,sym=-5lambda^3 y^6/288+O(y^8)`，严格证明 `Q_4` 不能由
  difference law 重构。
- 对完整 Schur 残差定义 `T_4=Re<conj(f_3)conj(f_1)^2h>`、
  `mathfrak Q_4=Q_4-T_4`。`b^(T)=(-a_3,-a_1,-a_1,a_1-a_2)` 给出
  `T_4,asym-T_4,sym=-lambda^3 y^6/54+O(y^8)`，因而
  `mathfrak Q_4,asym-mathfrak Q_4,sym=lambda^3 y^6/864+O(y^8)`。这把新信息
  解释为 shear `(s,t)->(s,s+t)` 下相邻 bispectrum cocycle
  `delta(s,t)-delta(s,s+t)` 的相容性。
- 可关闭的条件接口：局部 `B(s,t)>0` 或局部 `delta(s,t)=delta(s,s+t)`，均可由
  连续 Cauchy/二阶差分论证推出 `vartheta=0`，再得 `P_3K=0`。但 full exact
  ellipse average 是否足以推出 pointwise shear alignment 仍 **OPEN**。
- 本机新增 `four_point_bispectrum_shear_r108/README.md` 和 `audit_r108.py`。
  审计通过：`R108_ELLIPSE_BISPECTRUM_COORDINATES_PASSED`、
  `R108_FOUR_POINT_GRAM_AND_SCHUR_PASSED`、
  `R108_BISPECTRUM_CYCLE_REWRITE_PASSED`、

- 当前下一轮保持四点，不升级五点：**Four-Point Shear–Bispectrum Alignment
  Lemma**。只有 genuine characteristic phase lift 保留 nonzero shear cocycle
  时，才进入五点 Gram。

# 2026-09-07 — R109 Parallelogram Bochner cocycle disk 与 exactness gap

- 网页端 R109 证明：四点 `Gamma_4>=0` 加 full-exact ellipse average 不能单独
  推出 pointwise shear alignment。沿 `{0,s}` 公共 edge 的四频率 Gram 精确分解为
  `1/(1-|phi(s)|^2)*[[Delta_0,N],[conj(N),Delta_1]]`，故得到无松常数的
  `|N|^2<=Delta_0Delta_1` sharp cocycle disk。
- 用 `B(s,t)=ab conj(c)`、`B(s,s+t)=ac conj(d)` 的两个 phase 定义
  `eta=delta_0-delta_1`，可行域是单位圆与闭盘的交集，通常为 arc 而非点。
  Gaussian 四频率 kernel 严格正定，alignment point 位于 disk 严格内部；这给出
  四点 pointwise PSD 没有 equality-rigidity 的 no-go。
- R107 genuine OU-smoothed asymmetric law 确实实现 nonzero shear：
  `eta=-lambda^(3/2)s^2(s+t)+O(5)`，同时所有四点 Gram 自动 PSD；但其 exactness
  六阶缺陷为 `[z^6](Z-1)=-lambda^3/864`，沿 `z=iy` 为
  `Z(iy)=1+lambda^3y^6/864+O(y^8)`。R104 formal exact cascade 可保留 nonzero
  shear，却没有 probability realization。真正 OPEN 是两者交集。
- R109 明确了与主命题同层级的逻辑：在 genuine full-exact class 内，shear
  alignment 与排除 asymmetric exact law 等价，不能冒充独立中间定理。
- 得到真正缺失的充分输入：exact ellipse 上逐点
  `|B(s,s+t)|<=exp(-y^2/2)` 的 elliptic modulus saturation。它与 exact average
  通过三重等号强制 `delta=0`，再由 centered Cauchy 方程推出 `P_3K=0`；更强的
  `|phi(r)|<=exp(-r^2/2)` 可直接推出该 majorant。varying-bottom tower 能否
  给出 uniform modulus domination 仍 **OPEN**。
- 本机新增 `parallelogram_bochner_cocycle_r109/README.md` 与 `audit_r109.py`。
  审计通过：`R109_PARALLELOGRAM_SCHUR_DECOMPOSITION_PASSED`、
  `R109_COCYCLE_DISK_FACTORIZATION_PASSED`、
  `R109_SHEAR_AND_DEGREE6_EXACTNESS_GAP_PASSED`、
  `R109_ELLIPTIC_PRODUCT_GEOMETRY_PASSED`、
  `R109_PARALLELOGRAM_BOCHNER_COCYCLE_AUDIT_COMPLETED`。
- 下一轮不升五点，定为 **Elliptic Modulus-Saturation Lemma**：从 difference data、
  cocycle disk 和 positive backward-preimage cone 推进局部 product majorant；
  只有 genuine obstruction 出现才进入五点 Gram。

# 2026-09-07 — R110 Gaussian-relative modulus defect 与 q^(3N) 尺度

- 网页端 R110 因 connector 连续账户错误，未能诚实地重新读取本机 R109 文件；
  本轮网页推导作为 provisional theory input 记录，通信失败不被当作数学结论。
- 定义 L_mu(r)=log|phi_mu(r)|+r^2/2，精确得到
  L_(P_tau nu)(r)=L_nu(sqrt(tau)r)。有限深度
  g^(0)=P_(q^N)g^(N) 因而把六阶 modulus defect 缩放为 q^(3N)。
- 仅由 characteristic-function positivity 得到
  |phi_(g^(0))(r)|<=exp(-(1-q^N)r^2/2)，椭圆 product 版本同样只有 q^N
  二次误差；不能把 finite-depth positivity 偷换成 Gaussian modulus domination。
- 在 R103/R104 same-factor exact analytic 输入下，首个 odd cumulant 产生正的
  Gaussian-relative modulus defect；d=3 精确首项为
  L_mu(r)=kappa_3^2*r^6/240+O(r^8)，椭圆 product defect 也为正。
- 用 R107 genuine exact-fourth asymmetric law H 构造
  g_N^(j)=P_(q^(N-j))H。该 varying-bottom family 满足每个有限 OU 链，却有
  L_(g_N^(0))(r)=q^(3N)r^6/120+O(q^(4N)r^8)>0；它不是 full-exact counterexample，
  因为 kappa_6=-6 而 full exact 六阶要求 -3。这钉住了 finite-depth obstruction
  与 q^(3N) sharp local scale。
- 提出 clean conditional theorem：若底层类存在统一
  |L_mu(u)|<=C_*|u|^6、|u|<=r_*，则
  |L_(g^(0))(r)|<=C_*q^(3N)|r|^6，以及 R109 椭圆上的
  |M|<=C_*q^(3N)y^6，量词为 |r|<=r_*q^(-N/2)。
- 重要纠正：本机 parity_fredholm_ou_r12 并没有明确提供 C_*,r_* 的统一
  modulus envelope；R101 的 square-exponential 表述只支撑 moment-determinacy
  假设，不能自动替代本条件定理的输入。下一轮专攻从 positive backward cone、
  Schur–Abel 与 genuine realization 推出或反驳该统一包络。
- 本机新增 elliptic_modulus_defect_r110/README.md、audit_r110.py，exact audit
  已通过，待提交 Git。状态：有限公式 PROVED / LOCAL-AUDITED；
  首个 odd 反号 ANALYTICALLY PROVED under exactness inputs；统一包络定理
  CONDITIONAL；genuine asymmetric exclusion 与最终 tower rigidity OPEN。

# 2026-09-07 — R111 统一 square-exponential moment 到 uniform modulus 的显式桥

- 网页端 R111 因 connector 三次账户错误未能新增网页端 LOCAL-AUDITED 推导，
  但准确定位了最小缺口：统一 MGF/characteristic zero-free disk。
- 本机新增 uniform_modulus_source_r111/README.md 与 audit_r111.py，在明确
  条件 sup_(mu in C) E exp(aX^2)<=B 下，取
  rho=min(sqrt(a)/2,sqrt(a*e/(8B)))，用中心化 Taylor remainder 得到
  |M_mu(z)-1|<1/2 的统一圆盘，继而得到统一 K=log M 与累积量界。
- 对 kappa_4=0 类，显式得到 r_*=rho/2、C_*=2log(2)/rho^6，从而
  |L_(g^(0))(r)|<=C_*q^(3N)|r|^6（|r|<=r_*q^(-N/2)）及 R109 椭圆版本。
- 该桥只给 absolute two-sided control，不给 L<=0 的精确符号；R110 首个
  odd charge 的正 defect仍然存在。因此主问题进一步收缩为：从 positive cone、
  Schur–Abel 和 genuine exact realization 推出统一 a,B，或构造 obstruction。
- 本机 R111 exact audit 已通过：R111_ZERO_FREE_RADIUS_CONSTANTS_PASSED、
  R111_CUMULANT_TAIL_GEOMETRY_PASSED、R111_OU_AND_ELLIPSE_SCALING_PASSED、
  R111_D3_SIGN_INTERFACE_PASSED、R111_UNIFORM_MODULUS_SOURCE_AUDIT_COMPLETED。
- 状态：显式桥 PROVED / LOCAL-AUDITED under stated moment hypothesis；
  项目类是否满足该假设 CONDITIONAL/OPEN；charge annihilation、genuine
  asymmetric exclusion 与最终 tower rigidity 继续 OPEN。下一轮要求网页端
  只攻统一 a,B 的 positive-cone/Schur–Abel 来源，不重述 R99–R111。

# 2026-09-07 — R112 genuine exact class 的统一 square-exponential envelope

- 网页端 R112 在 connector 仍不可读时完成实质理论推进；核心是 R101 genuine
  angular barycenter + iid same-factor realization 给出
  Q=sum_j(X_j-X_bar)^2 ~ chi^2_2。
- 对 D=X_1-X_2，本机精确核验
  2Q-D^2=(X_1+X_2-2X_3)^2/3>=0；再用 Jensen
  E exp(aX^2)<=E exp(aD^2)，得到
  E exp(aX^2)<=1/(1-4a)、0<a<1/4，特别 a=1/8、B=2。
- 代入 R111 显式桥后，genuine full-exact class 统一拥有
  rho=sqrt(e/128)、r_*=sqrt(e/512)、C_*=2^22log(2)/e^3，以及
  |L_(g^(0))(r)|<=C_*q^(3N)|r|^6、|r|<=r_*q^(-N/2)，和 R109 椭圆版本。
  fixed-base 与 varying-bottom 在 analytic envelope 层不再有差别。
- 该结论不能由抽象 Herglotz cone alone 得到，也不能自动转移到 bare scalar
  RK=1；genuine angular realization/identification 是明确前提。
- 本机新增 uniform_subgaussian_exact_r112/README.md、audit_r112.py，审计
  通过：R112_PAIR_DIFFERENCE_SQUARE_IDENTITY_PASSED、
  R112_JENSEN_STRICT_CONVEXITY_PASSED、R112_EXPLICIT_ENVELOPE_CONSTANTS_PASSED、
  R112_ELLIPSE_AND_Q3N_SCALING_PASSED、
  R112_UNIFORM_SUBGAUSSIAN_EXACT_AUDIT_COMPLETED。
- 路线变化：统一解析半径、tail constants、sixth-order remainder 和 q^(3N)
  modulus scale 已不再是瓶颈；下一轮只攻 R109 sharp disk + R112 modulus
  budget 是否给出 q^(3N/2)y^3（或 square）shear-cocycle budget。bare RK=1
  identification、primitive charge annihilation 和最终 tower rigidity 继续 OPEN。

# 2026-09-07 — R113 uniform shear-cocycle budget 与 primitive obstruction

- 网页端 R113 在 connector 仍不可读时依据 R109/R112 自包含输入完成实质推进；
  本机新增 `uniform_shear_cocycle_budget_r113/README.md` 与 `audit_r113.py`。
- R109 四点圆盘在 Gaussian 邻域的 provisional expansion 给出：
  `Delta0=((2-m3^2)/4)V0^2+O(y^8)`、
  `Delta1=((2-m3^2)/4)V1^2+O(y^8)`、
  `N=((2-m3^2)/4)V0V1+O(y^7)`；degree-12 slack cancellation 后，
  Gaussian leading slack 为
  `det(H3)/144*s^6*t^2*(s+t)^4*(2s+t)^2`，且 `det(H3)=12`。
  这说明 Gaussian alignment 在 four-point disk 内部，pointwise PSD 没有
  shear-rigidity 的 equality mechanism。
- 由 R112 的统一 zero-free analytic log 与精确 OU phase transport，若
  `tau=q^(N-j)`、`rho=sqrt(e/128)`、`r_*=rho/2`，可取
  `C_ph=2(3+2sqrt(2))*log(2)/rho^3`，并在
  `|y|<=r_*tau^(-1/2)` 上得到
  `|eta_j(s,t)|<=C_ph*tau^(3/2)|y|^3`，以及 square 版
  `|eta_j|^2<=C_ph^2*tau^3|y|^6`。这是独立的 phase-analytic bound，
  不是从 modulus budget 取平方根；粗 phase scale 已关闭。
- R113 同时钉住 sharpness boundary：R107 varying-bottom law 的
  `kappa6=-6` 不满足 full-exact 的 `kappa6=-3kappa3^2`，但其 shear
  仍可达到 `q^(3N/2)y^3`；因此剩余的真正任务是 full exactness 对 primitive
  odd phase 的额外 annihilation，而不是继续改善粗尺度。
- 本机 audit 已核验 cubic shear identity、ellipse geometry、Gaussian Gram
  determinant、显式常数、`tau^3` scaling 与 R107 六阶 gap；完整 Gaussian
  asymptotic remainder 保持网页端 ANALYTICALLY PROVED，未被本机脚本过度宣称。
- 状态：uniform phase budget 在 genuine full-exact analytic class 下为
  PROVED / ANALYTICALLY PROVED；bare scalar `RK=1` identification、primitive
  charge annihilation 与最终 Positive Backward-Tower Exact Zero-Set Rigidity
  仍 OPEN。下一轮定为 R114 **Primitive Cubic Shear Limit**：计算
  `tau^(-3)*(Delta0Delta1-|N|^2-S_G)` 与 exact angular `tau^3` limit，
  判断 normalized four-point cone 是否仍只给 `|c_N|<=sqrt(2)`，或已强制
  `c_N->0`。

# 2026-09-07 — R114 Primitive Cubic Shear Limit 与 four-point no-go

- 网页端 R114 在 connector 不可读时按自包含 R109/R112/R113 数据完成了尺度
  审计。本机新增 `primitive_cubic_shear_limit_r114/README.md` 与 `audit_r114.py`。
- 令 `tau=q^N`、`h_N=g_N^(N)`、`c_N=kappa_3(h_N)`，固定物理频率下
  `mu_(tau,N)=P_tau h_N` 的 exact d=3 展开为
  `log phi_mu=-r^2/2-i*tau^(3/2)c_Nr^3/6+tau^3c_N^2r^6/240+...`；
  四点 Schur residual 满足
  `S_mu=S_G+tau^3c_N^2 F4+O(tau^4)`。
- 以 `Pi=s^6t^2(s+t)^4(2s+t)^2`、`H3=[m_(i+j)]` 展开，exact degree-six
  compatible jet 给出
  `det H3=12-30tau^3c_N^2-12tau^4c_Nd_N-tau^5d_N^2-6tau^6c_N^4`；
  因而 Gaussian 邻域
  `S_mu-S_G=-(5/24)tau^3c_N^2Pi+...`。这个修正虽为负，却不能从
  `S_mu>=0` 推出 `c_N=0`，因为 `S_G>0`，正定作用在绝对残差而非相对差上。
- 同步的 genuine full-exact angular functional 满足
  `tau^(-3)(Z_tau-1)=-(y^6/2592)(kappa_6(h_N)+3c_N^2)=0`；它只恢复
  `kappa_6=-3c_N^2`，不消灭 cubic charge。合法 primitive phase normalization
  是 `tau^(-3/2)eta -> -c_Ns^2(s+t)`；`r~tau^(-1/2)` 则进入指数小的
  `G4->I` 区域，不能与 fixed-frequency `tau^3` 系数混用。
- 网页端进一步给出 genuine probability finite-jet construction：
  `m1=0,m2=1,m3=c,m4=3,m6=15+7c^2` 对小非零 `c` 可实现，且 Bochner、
  positive OU、degree-six exact fingerprint 同时成立；它不是 all-degree
  exact counterexample，却证明任何只用 degree-six 与四点 PSD 的路线都不足。
- 本机 audit 核验 cumulant/moment substitution、`H3` determinant、Gaussian
  coefficient `1/12` 与 primitive coefficient `-5/24`、angular `tau^3`
  cancellation、scale/shear identities，全部通过。完整 trace-resolvent 与
  bump realization 仍标网页端 ANALYTICALLY PROVED，未过度升级证据。
- 状态：R114 得到严格 four-point local no-go：normalized cone 仍不超出
  `|c_N|<=sqrt(2)`，`c_N->0` 继续 OPEN。下一轮改攻 R115
  **Gaussian Four-Point Slack Saturation Lemma**：寻找 all-degree
  positive/backward mechanism，使某个 generic parallelogram 的残差相对
  Gaussian baseline 不低于 `S_G-o(q^(3N))`，或构造 genuine all-degree
  obstruction；不再继续无目的地计算更高有限阶 determinant。

# 2026-09-07 — R115 Gaussian-relative slack saturation 等价于 cubic exclusion

- 网页端 R115 完成了对预定 saturation 路线的结构性判决；本机新增
  `gaussian_four_point_saturation_r115/README.md` 与 `audit_r115.py`。
- 固定一个足够小 generic `(s0,t0)` 使 `F4(s0,t0)<0`，令
  `tau_N=q^N`、`h_N=g_N^(N)`、`c_N=kappa_3(h_N)`、
  `mu_N=P_(tau_N)h_N`。R114 expansion 写成
  `S_muN=S_G-lambda_4*tau_N^3*c_N^2+R_N`，`|R_N|<=C4*tau_N^4`。
  因而 `S_muN>=S_G-epsilon_N*tau_N^3`（epsilon_N->0）推出
  `lambda_4*c_N^2<=epsilon_N+C4*tau_N`，即 `c_N->0`；反向由 `c_N->0`
  得 saturation。故 Gaussian-relative saturation 与 primitive cubic
  annihilation 是同一层级的等价命题，不是独立辅助 lemma。
- 若 `|c_N|` 沿子序列下界为正，则 `S_muN<=S_G-const*q^(3N)`；这与
  absolute Bochner `S_muN>=0` 完全相容，因为 `S_G>0`。varying-bottom
  backward OU 只生成 `g_N^(j)=P_(q^(N-j))h_N`，不提供 `h_N` 与
  `h_(N+1)` 的跨 N coherence，因此不能凭自身令 `c_N` 衰减。
- R112 的统一 `E exp(X^2/8)<=2` 给出 tightness 与 all-moment uniform
  integrability。若存在 varying-bottom sequence `limsup|c_N|>0`，取
  `h_N=>h` 的子序列；矩收敛给 `kappa_3(h)!=0`，exact angular identity
  由 dominated convergence 传给 h，故 h 是 genuine full-exact 单律。
  反向用任意这样的 h 作 constant-top tower 即得 sequence。于是
  `varying-bottom nonvanishing cubic sequence` 与
  `genuine full-exact single law with kappa_3!=0` 等价。
- 这轮明确换路线：ordinary positive Gram minor 因 Gaussian 是 strict
  interior、`F(Gaussian)>0`，无法提供 Gaussian-relative `q^(3N)` 符号。
  成功的 global functional 至少需 `F(Gaussian)=0`、来自 genuine
  one-body/global factorization 的 `F(mu)>=0`，并在 primitive branch 上
  `F(P_tau h)=-C*c^2*tau^3+o(tau^3)`。
- 本机 audit 核验 `H3` primitive determinant 与 `-5/24`、saturation algebra、
  angular fingerprint、fixed/primitive rescaling separation、varying-bottom
  reduction scale 与 centered-functional signature，全部通过。完整 uniform
  remainder、compactness/dominated-convergence 和有限阶 moment-matching
  论证保留网页端 ANALYTICALLY PROVED / FINITE-ORDER OBSTRUCTION 等级。
- 状态：R115 严格排除了“再加强一个 four-point saturation lemma”作为独立
  进展；OPEN 已压缩为 single-law genuine factorized Gaussian-radial cubic
  exclusion。下一轮定为 R116 **Single-Law Factorized Gaussian-Radial Cubic
  Exclusion**：若三 iid factor 的二维 residual `R` 满足
`|R|^2~chi^2_2`，判断其 characteristic factorization 是否强制
`kappa_3(X)=0`。

# 2026-09-07 — R116 Single-Law Factorized Gaussian-Radial Cubic Exclusion

网页端 R116 完成了 single-law 全局压缩；connector 仍不可读，因此本轮依据
当前对话中的自包含 R115 基线继续。本机新增
`single_law_gaussian_radial_cubic_r116/README.md` 与 `audit_r116.py`，并将
网页端推导逐项分成 PROVED / ANALYTICALLY PROVED / CONDITIONAL / OPEN。

- 对 `omega=exp(2*pi*i/3)` 与 iid centered variance-one `X_j`，令
  `Z=sqrt(2/3)(X_1+omega X_2+omega^2X_3)`。本机核验
  `|Z|^2=sum_j(X_j-Xbar)^2`，并核验长度 `sqrt(2/3)` 的三向 tight frame
  `sum v_j=0`、`sum v_jv_j^T=I_2`。
- 在 `|Z|^2~chi^2_2` 下写 `Z=R exp(iTheta)`、
  `u_1(r)=E[exp(3iTheta)|R=r]`，得到
  `E Z^3=2sqrt(2/3)kappa_3(X)` 与
  `kappa_3=sqrt(3/8)int r^3u_1(r)r exp(-r^2/2)dr`。cubic charge因此只需
  一个 weighted first-harmonic annihilation，而非先证明 `u_1=0`。
- 给出 characteristic order-3 Hankel bridge
  `H_1(rho)=int J_3(rho r)u_1(r)r exp(-r^2/2)dr`，以及 MGF modified-Bessel
  bridge `c_1(z)=exp(-z^2/2)int I_3(zr)u_1(r)r exp(-r^2/2)dr`；本机核验
  `J_3,I_3` 的 `x^3/48` leading term 和系数
  `sqrt(2/3)kappa_3/24`。径向 exactness 只固定 zeroth mode `H_0=e^{-rho^2/2}`。
- 前向 OU 保持 radial exactness 并把 cubic 缩放为 `t^(3/2)`，故若 genuine
  nonzero-charge law 存在，可无损限到严格正 analytic one-body density。其
  residual real-space density为 same-factor three-line convolution
  `p_f(z)=int prod_j f(m/sqrt(3)+v_j dot z)dm`。
- 构造非因子化 smooth obstruction
  `dnu_epsilon=[1+2epsilon Re(z^3)e^{-|z|^2}]d gamma_2`：径向 law保持
  Gaussian 而 cubic moment非零。网页端给出的系数 `16epsilon/9` 经本机
  exact integral 检查为 `16epsilon/27`；已修正 README 与脚本，非零性结论不变。
- 保留条件性结果：classical infinitely divisible 加 full exact degree-six
  fingerprint `kappa_6=-3kappa_3^2`，因 `kappa_6>=0` 迫使 `kappa_3=0`，再由
  Levy measure 消失得到 Gaussian；positive backward OU 不自动给出 ID。
- R116 判决：
  `|Z|^2~chi^2_2` + strict same-factor product `=> kappa_3(X)=0` 仍 OPEN；
  这已经是 global three-line convolution first-harmonic annihilation，而非
  finite Gram/minor、tau 高阶或 numerical/SDP 问题。
- R117 最小命题：对严格正 analytic `f` 的 same-factor three-line convolution，
  Gaussian circular radialization 是否足以推出
  `int r^3u_1(r)r exp(-r^2/2)dr=0`。优先走 spherical-harmonic/
  total-positivity 或 `I_3(zr)` 正核路线。

# 2026-09-07 — R117 Cubic Heat-Norm Equivalence 与 Heat-Escort Barycenter

网页端 R117 在读取 R116 最新框架后完成了一维 heat-flow 压缩；connector 仍不可读，
因此依据当前对话自包含结论继续。本机新增
`heat_escort_barycenter_r117/README.md` 与 `audit_r117.py`，并严格区分
PROVED / ANALYTICALLY PROVED / OBSTRUCTION / OPEN。

- 令 `u_t=P_t f`、`Q=sum_j(X_j-Xbar)^2`。Gaussian completion 给出
  `int(P_t f)^3=(2*pi*t*sqrt(3))^(-1)E exp(-Q/(2t))`，从而
  `Q~chi^2_2` 当且仅当 `||P_t f||_3^3=1/(2*pi*sqrt(3)*(1+t))` 对所有 `t>0`。
  这是 genuine global 的双向 Laplace 等价。
- 令 `A=int u_t^3`、`I=int u_t(u_t')^2`、`J=int u_t(u_t'')^2`，exact branch
  满足 `A'=-3I`、`I'=-J`、`AJ=6I^2`；一般正密度只给 `AJ>=4I^2`，故 Gaussian
  exact value 仍在 strict interior，基础 positivity/rearrangement 不能直接
  提供 equality-case rigidity。
- 定义 `B(t)=int x(P_t f)^3dx`。tilted cubic completion 给
  `B(t)=(2*pi*t*sqrt(3))^(-1)E[Xbar exp(-Q/(2t))]`，且
  `E[Xbar Q]=2*kappa_3/3`，因此
  `B(t)=-kappa_3/(6*pi*sqrt(3))*t^(-2)+O(t^(-3))`。
  对 cubic escort law，`E_nu_t[X]=-kappa_3/(3t)+O(t^(-2))`，故
  `kappa_3=-3 lim_{t->infty}t E_nu_t[X]`。这是本轮最有价值的一维全局提取器。
- conditional-characteristic 版本令 `M=(sum Xj)/sqrt(3)`、`R=sqrt(Q)`：
  `G(xi,rho)=avg prod_j phi(xi/sqrt(3)+rho a_j)=E[e^{i xi M}J0(rho R)]`，
  `D=partial_xi G(0,rho)=-i*kappa_3*rho^2/(2sqrt(3))+O(rho^4)`。
  `B` 与 `D` 是同一个 signed conditional-mean measure
  `eta(dq)=E[Xbar;Q in dq]` 的 Laplace/Hankel 两种 transform；目标只需
  `int q eta(dq)=0`。
- 再次用精确非因子化 obstruction：
  `p_epsilon=(2*pi)^(-1)e^(-r^2/2)[1+2epsilon r^3e^(-r^2)cos(3theta)]`，其
  `u_1=epsilon r^3e^(-r^2)`，weighted moment为 `(16/27)epsilon`，因此

# 2026-09-07 — R118 Reflection-Gap Skew Energy 与 Mixed-Reflection Moment

网页端 R118 在读取 R117 记录后构造了反射极化的正 global gap；connector 仍不可读，
本轮依据当前对话自包含结论继续。本机新增
`reflection_gap_skew_energy_r118/README.md` 与 `audit_r118.py`。

- 令 `u_t=P_t f`、`check u_t(x)=u_t(-x)`、`e_t=(u_t+check u_t)/2`、
  `o_t=(u_t-check u_t)/2`，则
  `D(t)=int u_t^3-int u_t^2check u_t=4int e_to_t^2>=0`。
  本机特意核验了“逐点多出奇项、积分后消失”的细节，避免把积分式误写成点态式。
  `D=0` 对一个 `t>0` 即推出 symmetry 与 `kappa_3=0`，这是真正的 global
  equality mechanism。
- 取 `Y=(X_1,X_2,-X_3)`、`Qsharp=sum(Y_j-Ybar)^2`，Gaussian completion 给
  `D=(2*pi*t*sqrt(3))^(-1)[t/(1+t)-E exp(-Qsharp/(2t))]`，故有
  `E exp(-Qsharp/(2t))<=E exp(-Q/(2t))`。这是 same-factor/reflection 的
  无 phase cancellation 单边 order。
- 写 `h_t=o_t/e_t`，得到 `B(t)^2<=2(1+t)/(pi*t)D(t)`；所以
  `D=o(t^(-4))` 是推出 `B=o(t^(-2))` 的充分条件。
- exact moments 给
  `EQsharp=2`、`EQsharp^2=8`、`EQsharp^3=48+(224/27)kappa_3^2`。
  因此 Laplace gap leading term为 `(112/81)kappa_3^2lambda^3`，并核验
  `D(t)=7/(81*pi*sqrt(3))*kappa_3^2*t^(-4)+O(t^(-5))`。
  在 `kappa_3!=0` 时 `D/B^2->28*pi/(3sqrt(3))`；正 gap 是 `B^2` 的精确 global
  surrogate，但自然 decay rate仍容纳 nonzero cubic。
- reflection mixture `f_lambda=((1+lambda)/2)f+((1-lambda)/2)check f` 满足
  `int(P_t f_lambda)^3=A_G-3/4(1-lambda^2)D`；zeroth overlap 只表达
  symmetric deficit 与 odd energy 的补偿，不能独自 annihilate skew。
- 条件性可发表接口：若另有 `E exp(-Qsharp/(2t))=t/(1+t)-o(t^(-3))`，或
  `EQsharp^3<=48`，则立即得 `kappa_3=0`。但现有 Hölder/reflection natural
  direction 是 `EQsharp^3>=48`，方向相反；因此 R118 核心仍 OPEN。
- R119 最小命题：**Mixed-Reflection Third-Moment Reversal**，寻找其它 global
  same-factor structure 是否能给 `EQsharp^3<=48` 或 Laplace gap `o(lambda^3)`；
  若不行，转向 `E[Xbar J_0(rho sqrt(Q))]` 的 conditional-mean diagonal。

- 令 `Q=Σ(Xj-Xbar)^2`、`Y=(X1,X2,-X3)`、`Qsharp=Σ(Yj-Ybar)^2`。本机核验
  `Qsharp=Q+(4/3)X3(X1+X2)`，并在任意 centered iid、六阶矩有限条件下核验
  `EQsharp=EQ`、`EQsharp^2=EQ^2`、
  `EQsharp^3-EQ^3=(224/27)(EX^3)^2`。故 exact class 的 reverse third-moment
  comparison 与 `kappa_3=0` 完全等价，不再作为独立中间引理。
- 同样核验 Laplace gap
  `L(λ)-Lsharp(λ)=(112/81)kappa_3^2λ^3+O(λ^4)`；`o(λ^3)` saturation
  也是原 cubic exclusion 的等价重写。mixed-sign characteristic 的 modulus
  与 ordinary product逐点相同，因此 modulus-only 路线严格盲于 cubic sign。
- 定义 `h(q)=E[Xbar|Q=q]`、`nu(dq)=1/2e^{-q/2}dq`，核验 centered 只给
  `∫h dnu=0`，而 `kappa_3=(3/2)∫qh dnu`；profile `h0=q-2` 核验
  `∫h0dnu=0` 但 `∫qh0dnu=4`，说明单调/一次变号不足。
- 对 `rho=(log f)'`、`Sigma_0=Σrho(Xj)`、
  `Sigma_R=Σ(Xj-Xbar)rho(Xj)`，网页端给出并本机核验代数接口
  `E[Sigma_R|Q=q]=-q`、
  `E[Xbar Sigma_R|Q=q]=2q h'(q)-qh(q)`，从而
  `2qh'(q)=Cov(Xbar,Sigma_R|Q=q)`，以及
  `kappa_3=(3/2)E[Cov(Xbar,Sigma_R|Q)]`。这是新的 same-factor、score-sensitive、
  conditional、global-in-q 结构。
- 条件性小定理：若整个 exact class 上 covariance 具有 reflection-stable 固定
  符号，则应用于 `f` 与 `check f` 迫使 `h'=0`、`h=0`、`kappa_3=0`；但
  orientation-dependent `sign h'=sign kappa_3` 不够。
- R119 判决：核心仍 OPEN；真正缺口从神秘 reverse 矩不等式变成
  **Conditional Radial-Score Sign / Total-Positivity Lemma**。R120 研究能否由

- 定义 `a_j(theta)=sqrt(2/3)cos(theta+2*pi*j/3)`、
  `F_theta(q,m)=prod f(m+sqrt(q)a_j)`、`K_f=avg_theta F_theta`。本机核验
  `sum a_j=0`、`sum a_j^2=1`，并确认 exact radial marginal 只固定 row mass
  `A(q)=int K_f dm=C_0e^{-q/2}`。
- shell score 微分给 `partial_q log F_theta=Sigma_R/(2q)`，归一化后
  `h'(q)=Cov(Xbar,Sigma_R|Q=q)/(2q)`。因此 covariance fixed-sign 等价于
  shell kernel 的 universal MLR orientation。
- 本机核验 reflection `K_check(q,m)=K_f(q,-m)`、`h_check=-h`、TP2/RR2 取向交换；
  若 whole exact class 具有 reflection-stable fixed TP/RR orientation，则 shell
  kernel 同时 TP2/RR2，严格正性使其 rank one，进而 `Xbar` 与 `Q` 独立、`kappa_3=0`。
  该结论是 CONDITIONAL，不把前提误当 exactness 已推出。
- 核验 strict log-concavity 的逐角 cross-curvature公式；仅 `rho'<0` 不给固定方向，
  需要 `rho'` 单调但仍 orientation-dependent。显式正 rank-one 矩阵 A/B 的和
  determinant `-8910` 核验 anglewise TP 不在 angular mixture 下闭合。
- 得到精确 within/between 分解：
  `2q h'=E_w[Cov(Xbar,Sigma_R|q,theta)]+Cov_w(m_theta,r_theta)`。
  exact radial 只给 `E_w r_theta=-q`，不控制 between-angle coherence 项；这就是
  ordinary TP/MLR 路线的真正缺口。
- 保留 analytic strict-log-concave same-factor degree-six-compatible obstruction：
  小 Hermite 对偶扰动可取 `kappa_3=c`、`kappa_4=0`、`kappa_6=-3c^2`，可与反射
  `f_-c=check f_c` 配对。它不是 full-exact project counterexample，但排除了

- R120 判决：核心仍 OPEN；R121 最小命题是 **Angular-Mixture Coherence Lemma**，只攻

- 引入 `A_theta(q,lambda)=∫e^(lambda m)F_theta(q,m)dm`、`w_(q,lambda)`；
  `lambda=3s` 是 one-body Esscher tilt 的 genuine same-factor transverse direction。
  本机核验 `S_lambda=m_theta-h`、`S_q=(r_theta+q)/(2q)` 的尺度接口。
- `C_ang=Cov_w(m_theta,r_theta)=2q I_(lambda q)^ang`；严格正性给 positive
  Toeplitz/Fisher cross representation
  `C_ang/(2q)=<alpha,T_(1/w)beta>` 与 diagonal energies非负，因此只有
  `|C_ang|^2<=4q^2 I_ll I_qq`，不能给 sign。此 cross 是 off-diagonal bilinear，
  不是可写成非负 squares 的 quadratic form。
- 本机核验 reflection 下 cross term 翻号、diagonal Fisher energies不变，且
  R120 的 within/between decomposition就是 Fisher chain rule。static radial
  exactness只固定 `u_0(q)=1`；R101 static Herglotz rows不控制新的 Esscher
  tangent `alpha_k=∂lambda u_k|0`。直接对 exact identity 求 Esscher 导数会偷加
  “exact class 对 Esscher 一阶稳定”的强假设。
- 保留 obstruction：anglewise/static Herglotz positivity、Fisher square energies、
  finite exact rows、strict log-concavity 与 same-factor 本身都不足以给
  `C_ang` 的 reflection-stable sign；任意 finite rows 的 analytic strict-
  log-concave same-factor construction仍可带 nonzero cubic，但不是 full-exact反例。
- 条件性接口：若有 Esscher-radial Fisher orthogonality，或 genuine exact class
  上 reflection-stable fixed-sign cross theorem，则可推出 `h'=0`、`kappa_3=0`；
  但前提本身等价于目标层级，不能升级为 PROVED。

  `s(x)=-partial_v log Phi(-x,v)|0`，并给出 `d=-s` 下的 interior tangential
  compatibility。这说明 same-factor trace 确实能重构 one-body score，但这是
  factorization compatibility，不是新的 positivity inequality。
- 在三维 extension
  `tilde Phi(xi,eta)=prod_j phi(xi/sqrt(3)+v_j dot eta)` 中，本机核验
  `Delta_eta log tilde Phi=2 partial_xi^2 log tilde Phi`，以及
  `Psi=Phi/(i*sqrt(3))*partial_xi log tilde Phi`。mean-charge trace 是
  reflection-odd first normal Cauchy datum。
- 整理 `Phi -> Psi -> {u_k,g_k} -> {alpha_k}` 的 Fourier/Hankel interface；
  零阶目标为 `G_0(rho)=E[Xbar J_0(rho sqrt(Q))]`
  `=-kappa_3rho^2/6+O(rho^4)`。log first-harmonic lowering 将
  `P_1^log=-i kappa_3rho^3/(12sqrt(6))+...` transport 为

- 本机核验 exact radial branch 的 Schwarz budget
  `|G_0|^2 <= (1/3)e^{-rho^2}(I_0(rho^2)-1)=rho^4/12+O(rho^6)`。
  该量 reflection-even，只是 magnitude budget，不能推出 cubic zero。
- 本机核验 genuine analytic tangent obstruction：
  `psi=sin(ax)-c sin(bx)` 可满足一阶 centered constraint，却有非零
  `H_3` moment；IFT exponential family 可保持 centered/variance-one、positive、
  analytic、strict-log-concave、same-factor，而所有 radial test 的一阶变化因
  全局 reflection oddness 为零。该 obstruction 不是 all-degree exact counterexample，
  但排除了靠 radial 一阶信息闭合的可能。

R122 判决：PROVED / ANALYTICALLY PROVED 为 trace reconstruction、log-wave、

- 在 mean–residual 坐标中 `w_j=(1/sqrt(3),v_j)` 是正交标准基，故
  `tilde Phi(y)=prod_j phi(w_j dot y)` 满足
  `tilde Phi in PD(R^3) iff phi in PD(R)`：一方向由 product of PD functions，
  反方向由 factor-axis restriction。这是本轮最重要的全局降维：三维 Bochner
  没有超出 one-body probability realizability 的新正性。
- 对 `L=log tilde Phi`、`L_0=L(0,eta)`、`N=partial_xi L(0,eta)`，本机记录
  even/odd Cauchy hierarchy
  `partial_xi^(2k)L=2^(-k)Delta^kL_0`、

  `J_1=-iFN`、`J_2=-F[1/2 Delta L_0+N^2]`。
- 矩阵值 conditional moment kernel 的 Schur complement 是
  `Var(M|R)>=0`。全局 reflection `(M,R)->(-M,-R)` 下 `N/J_1` 翻号而
  `J_2`、conditional variance、Schur determinant、quadratic energy 不变。
  因而得到 **Global Quadratic-Bochner Parity Lemma**：所有自然 quadratic
  Bochner flux 只看到 `N^2` 或 odd-odd pairing，不能给 reflection-stable linear
  sign；除非 exactness 另行把某个 baseline-zero energy 固定为零。
- 令 `H(Q)=E[M|Q]`，exact radial branch 给出
  `E H^2 >= kappa_3^2/3`，说明 nonzero cubic 反而产生 positive explained-mean
  energy；而 circular nonlinear flux含未知的 `E[M^2J_0]`，不是 rigidity inequality。
- 构造 Bochner-only genuine obstruction：`R~N(0,I_2)`，
  `M|Q=q~N(epsilon(e^-q-1/3),1-epsilon^2(e^-q-1/3)^2)`。此 joint law
  genuine、analytic、full-PD、residual fully Gaussian 且 exact radial，但
  `E[M Q]=-4epsilon/9!=0`。它不是 same-factor 项目反例，却证明任何有效机制
  必须使用 one-body factorization，而不能继续换 Bochner flux。
- R104 formal odd all-degree branch 仍能同时满足 same-factor、log-wave、exact
  circular identity 并保留 `N_0~c rho^2`；严格标 FORMAL。varying-bottom backward
  OU 从任何 genuine asymmetric exact single law自动给 tower，因此也不能单独
  增加 restriction。

R123 判决：PROVED 为 factor-axis Bochner equivalence、Cauchy hierarchy、矩阵值
conditional moments、explained-mean bound、circular flux identity、residual-
Gaussian obstruction；ANALYTICALLY PROVED 为 quadratic parity no-go；FORMAL 为

- 明确 exact row：令 `Q=Σ(Xj-Xbar)^2`、
  `Y_theta=Σa_j(theta)Xj`，则
  `[z^(2r)](<ΠM(z a_j)>-e^(z^2/2))=(EQ^r-2^r r!)/(4^r(r!)^2)`。
  因此第 `r` 个 row 精确定义为 `R_r=EQ^r-2^r r!=0`，不是形式化的模糊约束。
- 得到关键 finite-row bootstrap：`(X1-X2)^2<=2Q`；第 `r` 个 row 给
  `E|X1-X2|^(2r)<=4^r r!`，再对独立 centered copy 用条件 Jensen 得
  `EX^(2r)<=4^r r!`。所以前 `M` rows 自动给截断包络
  `EΣ_{r=0}^M(X^2/8)^r/r!<=2-2^(-M)`，无需先验统一尾界。
- Envelope-Free Fixed-c Compactness Theorem：定义 `E_M(c)` 为 genuine
  centered、variance-one、`kappa_3=c` 且前 `M` rows 成立的 laws。若
  `E_M(c)!=empty` 对所有 `M`，variance one 给 tightness；bootstrap 给所有固定
  moments 的 uniform integrability，弱极限保留 `kappa_3=c` 和所有 rows，并由
  moment caps 得 `E exp(X^2/8)<=2`。MGF entire、identity theorem 与 Hankel
  uniqueness 再给 genuine full-exact asymmetric law。
- 因此若 cubic exclusion 为真，则固定 `c!=0` 后某个有限 `M(c)` 的 genuine
  finite-row realization 必失败；这比“uniform envelope blow-up”更强。此前 R115/R120
  只允许每个固定 `M` 的小 cubic `|c|<c_*(M)`，没有证明 `inf_M c_*(M)>0`；若
  cubic exclusion成立，固定-gap admissible radius 必须沿高阶衰减或 finite
  Hamburger cone 联合不可行。
- 定义 genuine finite-row cubic radius
  `Gamma_M=sup{|kappa_3|:R_1=...=R_M=0}`，核验其单调性并得到
  `cubic exclusion iff Gamma_M->0`。同时定义有限截断 Hamburger 集合：
  `y0=1,y1=0,y2=1,y3=c`、`H_M(y)>=0`、`R_r(y)=0`、
  `0<=y_{2r}<=4^r r!`。若所有阶非空，坐标对角化、Hamburger theorem 和
  Carleman 给 genuine full-exact law；若主命题成立，必存在有限可检验空集。
- 本轮没有做 SDP/optimizer，也没有声称找到了第一个失败的 principal minor、
  显式 `M(c)` 或 `Gamma_M` 的衰减率。

R124 判决：PROVED / ANALYTICALLY PROVED 为 exact-row moment formula、
finite-row moment bootstrap、envelope-free compactness、all-row-to-global-exact
升级、moment determinacy、fixed-gap dichotomy 和 truncated-Hamburger interface；
CONDITIONAL 为把主命题取反后的 finite failure / `Gamma_M->0`；FORMAL 为 R104

  `R_r=(2^r/3^(r-1))y_{2r}+P_r(y0,...,y_{2r-1})-2^r r!`；relaxed finite
  sets compact，`GammaHat_M` 取得最大值并单调不增；genuine `Gamma_M` 保证有限，
  但 finite-level 顶阶矩可能泄漏到无穷，不能一般性声称取得最大值。若某层
  genuine extremizer 存在，才可由至多 `2M+1` 原子的 cubature 实现。
- 主要小定理 **R125-A**：若 `Gamma_infty` 是 genuine full-exact class 的最大
  cubic skew，则
  `lim_M Gamma_M=lim_M GammaHat_M=Gamma_infty`，从而
  `GammaHat_M-Gamma_M->0`。这不意味着单个 finite truncation representable，
  只说明 ghost gap 在渐近上消失。
- **R125-B**：固定非零 cubic gap 若能穿过所有 finite row/cap/Hankel constraints，
  紧性最终会把它升级为 genuine full-exact law；不存在“固定 c 永远只是 formal
  但通过全部 finite PSD”的第三种情况。已审计的 finite-row perturbations 说明
  每个固定阶仍有小的 genuine nonzero-cubic 邻域，所以没有固定 finite degree
  可以直接 annihilate cubic。
- **R125-C**：前 `M` rows 给 growing Fourier-window bound
  `|E J0(t sqrt(Q))-e^(-t^2/2)|<=2|t|^(2M)/(2^M M!)`，在
  `|t|<=alpha sqrt(M)`、`alpha<sqrt(2/e)` 上指数衰减。它只是 radial approximation，
  不提供 first-harmonic sign。
- **R125-D**：令 `n=floor(M/2)`，Laguerre–Christoffel kernel 给
  `P(Q=0)<=1/(n+1)`；iid 时 `sum_x mu{x}^3<=1/(n+1)`，有限原子 law 的支持数
  至少为 `sqrt(n+1)`。该 anti-atomicity 不控制连续 asymmetric law 的 skew。
- 因此 `Gamma_M->0` 仍 OPEN，而且由 R125-A 等价于 genuine cubic exclusion，
  不是一个显然更弱的中间命题。R126 将转向 finite extremizer 的 singular ghost
  elimination。

R125 判决：PROVED / ANALYTICALLY PROVED 为 finite row triangular structure、
relaxed/genuine radius 的渐近 exactness、fixed-gap no-purely-formal escape、
growing Fourier window 与 Laguerre anti-atomicity；CONDITIONAL 为 `Gamma_M->0`
若 cubic exclusion 成立；FORMAL 为 R104 odd branch；OBSTRUCTION 为 finite
Hankel ghost、radial approximation、anti-atomicity 和固定阶 PSD 均不能给 cubic
sign；OPEN 是 `Gamma_M->0`。

下一步 R126：**Singular-Ghost Elimination at the Cubic Extremum**，研究
`T_M` 的 cubic maximizer 是否可选为 positive-definite/flat；若不能，构造并量化
singular non-flat extremizing branch。

# 2026-09-07 — R126 M=3 Singular Ghost Extremum

网页端连接仍被另一个工作区占用期间，本机完成了 R126 的 `M=3` 精确小定理，
新增 `singular_ghost_extremum_r126/`。在 `y_3=c`、`y_5=4c` 下，exact rows 给出
`y_4=3`、`y_6=15+7c^2`，而 `det H_2=2-c^2` 给出 `|c|<=sqrt(2)`。
端点向量 `(1,0,1,sqrt(2),3,4sqrt(2),29)` 的 `H_3` 为 singular non-flat，
`H_2` kernel 强制 `X^2-sqrt(2)X-1=0`，从而 representing law 会有 `y_6=11`，
与 exact row 要求的 `y_6=29` 矛盾。对 `|c|<sqrt(2)`，同一族的 `H_3` positive
definite，截断 Hamburger theorem 给 genuine representing law。因此

`GammaHat_3=Gamma_3=sqrt(2)`，但 relaxed 最大值由 ghost 取得，genuine 半径只是
不取得的 supremum。这是 R125 finite ghost 边界的第一个完全量化实例，不关闭全阶
`Gamma_M->0`，但明确了后续必须研究高阶 singular kernel 如何被下一行打破。

本机审计已通过：`R126_SINGULAR_GHOST_EXTREMUM_AUDIT_COMPLETED`。

# 2026-09-07 — R127 M=4 Cubic Radius Flat Extremum

在 R126 `M=3` singular non-flat ghost 后，本机把第四个 exact row 完整纳入。令
`c=y_3,a=y_5`，前三行给 `y_4=3,y_6=15+7c^2`，第四行给
`y_8=105-124c^2+32ca`。对 `H_4` 关于 `H_2` 取 Schur complement 后，PSD 强制
`D(c,a)>=0` 与 `N(c,a)<=0`；边界消元得到唯一 `u_4 in (1,2)`，其中
`P(u_4)=0`、`u_4=1.110047790304544...`，从而
`GammaHat_4=Gamma_4=sqrt(u_4)=1.053588055315997...`。
极值点满足 `rank H_2=rank H_3=rank H_4=3`，是 flat genuine extremizer；因此
R126 的 `M=3` ghost 在下一 exact row 被明确消除。全阶 `Gamma_M->0` 仍 OPEN。

本机审计已通过：`R127_M4_CUBIC_RADIUS_AUDIT_COMPLETED`。

# 2026-09-07 — R128 Singular extension compatibility 与 `R_5` exact row

网页端连接仍被另一个工作区占用期间，本机继续推进下一轮接口而未停在局部数值上。
对任意 PSD moment block `H_M` 的 kernel 向量 `p`，PSD 扩展到 `H_{M+1}` 必须满足
`p^T(y_{M+1},...,y_{2M+1})=0`；等价地新列属于 `Ran(H_M)`。扩展的广义 Schur
缺陷 `delta=y_{2M+2}-b^T H_M^+b` 非负，且 `delta=0`/`delta>0` 分别精确区分
flat extension 与 singular non-flat ghost 方向。

新增 `singular_extension_compatibility_r128/README.md` 与 `audit_r128.py`；复核
发现临时展开误用了 `sum pair differences / 2`，与项目一直使用的
`Q=sum pair differences / 3` 不一致；此前关于 `y_10<0` 和严格下降的结论已撤回。
校正后 `R_5` 常数为 `9720`，前三行与 R4 下化为
`y_10=3(17a^2-280ac+20bc+470c^2+315)`。

进一步在 R127 的 `c_4` endpoint 上取兼容的 `y_9`，完整 `H_5` Schur 补为
`diag(0,0,delta_5)`，且有理区间证书给 `delta_5>0`（数值约
`913.705421573084`）。因此 R127 flat endpoint 在 M=5 正确地抬升为 singular
non-flat ghost；投影上界与显式构造共同给出
`boxed{GammaHat_5=GammaHat_4=c_4}`。本轮严格结果是 relaxed M=5 的精确端点及其
ghost 性质；genuine `Gamma_5` 和全阶衰减仍 OPEN。

# 2026-09-08 — R129 M=6 exact extension audit

本机新增 `r129_m6_exact_extension_audit/README.md` 与 `audit_r129.py`。在项目固定
归一化 `Q=(1/3)sum_{i<j}(X_i-X_j)^2` 下，对 `Q^6` 做精确符号展开，并顺序代入
R2--R5，得到

`y_12=-7749c^4-16380c^2+14220ca-2160cb+100cd-1926a^2+252ab+10395`,

其中 `c=y_3,a=y_5,b=y_7,d=y_9`，且 `y_11` 不出现；Gaussian check 给
`y_12=10395`。脚本通过 `R129_R6_EXACT_ROW_PASSED`。

随后把 R128 endpoint 的 `H_5` 与新列分块。R128 的旧 Schur 补是
`S_5=diag(0,0,delta_5)`，而 H6 的新 Schur 补为
`S_6=[[S_5,r],[r^T,sigma_6]]`。前两项 range compatibility 是
`r_0=r_1=0`，新 odd moment `y_11` 只进入 `r_2`。在 R127 endpoint 的
`B=0,P(c^2)=0` 下，精确恒等式给出 `r_0=0`、`r_1=delta_5`，而 R128
区间证书给 `delta_5>0`。因此该具体 R128 rank-4 singular non-flat ghost
不能延伸到 PSD `H_6`；marker 为
`R129_M6_R128_GHOST_EXCLUDED_ANALYTICALLY` 与
`R129_M6_EXACT_EXTENSION_AUDIT_COMPLETED`。

本轮结论需要补上一个由既有接口组成的全局推论。R125 的 relaxed Hankel
compactness 保证 M6 最大值取得，投影单调性给出
`GammaHat_6<=GammaHat_4=c_4`。若等号成立，M4 投影必须落在 R127 的
equality locus；R127 的 `D=0`、`N=0` 与对 `a` 的严格单调性把该点唯一化为
`(c_4,a_4,b_4)`（反射除外），而 R4/R5 行强制出 R128 ghost。R129 的
`r_1=delta_5>0` 已排除其 PSD H6 extension。因此在 R125 compactness 和
R127 equality classification 均按既有审计结果采用时，严格推出

`GammaHat_6<GammaHat_5=GammaHat_4=c_4`。

故本轮等级为：`PROVED`（R6 消元、raw expansion 与 Schur block 线性代数）；
`ANALYTICALLY PROVED`（R128 endpoint no-go，以及结合紧性/等号分类后的
全局严格 relaxed bound）；`OBSTRUCTION`（old-kernel 的首个未检测
recurrence defect）。仍为 `OPEN` 的是 `GammaHat_6` 的显式数值、genuine
`Gamma_6` 的显式值、严格 gap 的定量下界、backward-OU 正性锥和全阶
`Gamma_M->0`。因此不是把 endpoint 排除直接偷换成全局结论，而是明确使用
“最大值取得 + M4 等号唯一化 + R129 endpoint no-go”的三步闭合链。

# 2026-09-08 — R130 网页端任务已发送，等待完整推导

R129 的本机修订已提交并推送到 `temp` 仓库的 `main` 与
`theory/r129-active`，当前 HEAD 为 `2bf1e7c`。由于旧网页会话达到长度
上限，本轮在“数学定理证明”项目中新建会话并发送 R130；网页端已回显
其读取了 README、路线框架、工作日志以及 R125--R129 审计记录，并确认了
`2bf1e7c`，随后开始把 R127 Schur 条目与 R129 compatibility defect 放到
同一坐标系，目标是量化 endpoint 邻域的 exclusion modulus。

当前只记录为 `DISPATCHED / IN PROGRESS`，不把网页端的中间状态冒充为
定理。R130 的要求是：核验 `GammaHat_6<c_4` 的全局逻辑，尝试显式 gap
或 uniform modulus，抽象 kernel-adapted recurrence-defect lemma，并连接
到 positive backward-OU cone。最终网页正文返回后，再逐式加入本机审计，
并更新 `main` 与 `theory/r129-active`；在此之前 R130 的新数学结论仍为
`OPEN / PENDING WEB RESPONSE`。

# 2026-09-08 — R130 本机显式 gap 证书完成，网页端仍待回传

网页端 R130 会话在连接器工具层停留于处理中；为避免研究停在桥接层，本机先
完成了同一目标的独立精确审计，新增 `r130_m6_gap_audit/README.md` 与
`audit_r130.py`。脚本使用 `Fraction` 有理区间、精确多项式符号和直接 Schur
恒等式核验，未使用 optimizer 或浮点扫描。

证书链如下：

- R127 根多项式的唯一根区间为 `1.05358<c_4<1.05359`；对排除窗口
  `1.0535<=c<=1.05359`，R127 的 H4 Schur 条件把 `a=y_5` 压到
  `7.5698<a<7.571`，并给 `S_00<1/100`、`S_11<1/16`。
- H4 非对角 Schur 项给出 `70.29<b_*<70.4`，PSD 二阶主子式进一步给出
  `70.2<b=y_7<70.5`。
- R129 的 H6 Schur 补残差恒等式经直接符号核验为 `S_13=r_1`；在上述有理盒
  上精确证明 `r_1>800`。但 H6 PSD 要求
  `r_1^2<=S_11S_33`，而 `S_33<=y_12<=4^6 6!`，右侧严格小于
  `(1/16)·2,949,120=184,320`，与 `r_1^2>640,000` 矛盾。

因此本机得到新的有限层结论
`GammaHat_6<=1.0535`，并由根区间得到
`c_4-GammaHat_6>0.00008`；相应地
`Gamma_6<=GammaHat_6<=1.0535`。证据等级为
`ANALYTICALLY PROVED`（显式 relaxed 上界/gap 证书），不是 `GammaHat_6` 精确值，
更不是 genuine、全阶或 positive/backward-OU 结论。

本轮 marker：

网页端状态仍只记为 `DISPATCHED / IN PROGRESS`，不能把本机结果伪装成网页已完成

`S_13` 的 kernel-adapted defect，再回接 positive/backward-OU 主线。

# 2026-09-08 — 网页 R130 强 gap 已由本机补证

网页端 R130 已完成并提出更强候选结论
`c_4-GammaHat_6>25/28196`。本机没有直接采信，而是新增
`r130_web_gap_audit/README.md` 与 `audit_r130_web.py`，复核 exact identity、
移动 endpoint 区间和 R6 尾项估计。

复核通过的关键 marker 为：

`R130W_MEAN_VALUE_CONSTANT_PASSED`

`R130W_EXPLICIT_GAP_CANDIDATE_AUDIT_COMPLETED`

本机复核还定位并修正了网页正文的一处常数跳步：`C(u)<-33` 不能由
polynomial part `<252` 与第二项 `<-280` 直接推出；把 polynomial part 用
精确单调性收紧到 `<247` 后，才得到 `C<-33`，进而 `delta(u)>700`。

因此当前主线可以记录为：在已有 R125/R127 接口上，网页 R130 的强 gap 经本机
补证后为 `ANALYTICALLY PROVED`，即
`GammaHat_6<c_4-25/28196<1.052702`，并有
`Gamma_6<=GammaHat_6`。这仍不是 `GammaHat_6` 的精确值，也不是 genuine
全阶、正性或 backward-OU rigidity 的解决。

网页端同时给出一个值得保留的统一命题：若
`H_{m+1}=[[H_m,b],[b^T,tau]]>=0`，`G=K^T H_m K`、`d=K^T b`，则
`d in Ran(G)` 且 `d^T G^+d<=tau`；取 `K` 为旧 kernel 后得到 `d=0`。
对 `C(p)=sum p_j y_{m+1+j}`，新 top odd moment 的系数为 `p_m`，所以
低于最高次数的旧 kernel defects 不可能由该一个 odd moment 修复。这已把
R129 的 `p,xp` 机制提升为可推广的 kernel-compression Schur proposition。

下一轮 R131：先对 normalized/orthogonal-polynomial kernel defect 建立不受
`4^M M!` raw cap 淹没的递推，再尝试把有限层显式 gap 连接到
positive/backward-OU exact-zero-set 主命题。

# 2026-09-08 — R131 normalized defect 推进与条件边界

网页端 R131 已完成一轮实质推导。本机新增
`r131_normalized_defect_audit/` 并通过 `R131_NORMALIZED_DEFECT_AUDIT_COMPLETED`。

在 genuine `dmu=g dgamma`、`g>=0`、`g in L2(gamma)` 且
`epsilon=||g-1||_2` 时，Gaussian hypercontractivity 给出 degree-`m` 的
Hermite Gram coercivity：

`||G_m^mu-I||_op<=epsilon 3^m`。

于是 monic Jacobi norm 和 recurrence coefficient 满足
`(1-delta_k)k!<=h_k<=(1+delta_k)k!`、`delta_k=epsilon3^k`，以及
`beta_k/k` 的显式上下界。固定 shift `j` 时，
`||x^j p||_mu^2` 只带 `4^j(m+j)!/m!` 的 fixed-shift 多项式增长，解释了
为什么 normalized basis 比 raw `4^m m!` cap 更适合传播 kernel defect。

本机 exact audit 还确认：

- `R7` 的新最高奇矩 `y13` 不出现在 exact row，且 `y14` 系数为 `128/729`；
- flat rank-`r` 的 `H_m` 延拓有 `m-r` 条 frozen compatibility 方程，只有
  最后一条能看见 monic 的新 top odd moment；
- Hermite Gram determinant 与 Jacobi recurrence 的字典精确成立；
- OU 三阶 Hermite eigen-scaling 接口精确成立。

这些结果的等级是 `PROVED`（超收缩性作为标准分析输入）。但网页端进一步使用的
uniform 断言 `||P_(rho^N)h_N-1||_2=O(rho^(3N/2))` 当前没有在本机既有记录中
独立闭合；R57 直接已有的是 `m3^2<=2lambda(2-lambda)`。所以 growing
Jacobi window 及其对 positive backward-OU 的使用暂记 `CONDITIONAL`，不把
整段 `L2` 速率伪装成已证。

R131 将剩余主问题精确压缩为一个可发表的桥接目标：证明非零 `P3K` 的 genuine
same-factor exact solution 必在 `k<=c log(1/||g-1||_2)` 内制造固定的
normalized Jacobi/Gram recurrence defect；这与
`||G_m-I||<=epsilon3^m` 将直接矛盾。该 separation、`P3K` 与 `m3` 的零集
关系、以及 full positive backward-OU rigidity 仍为 `OPEN`。

# 2026-09-08 — R132 exact-law smoothing 与 log-density 弱桥接

网页端 R132 直接审计了 R131 暂时条件化的 uniform backward-OU 输入。本机新增
`r132_exact_law_smoothing_audit/`，不把网页正文照单全收：其中 Mehler 平方范数
的精确前因子已纠正，并以精确符号检查记录。

## 最强新结论

设 `mu` 是 centered、variance-one 的 genuine probability law，且其 iid 三元组
实际满足所有 exact rows

`E Q^r=2^r r!`, `Q=sum_i (X_i-Xbar)^2`, `r=0,1,2,...`。

由 Stieltjes--Carleman determinacy，`Q~chi^2_2`；再由
`Q>=(X_1-X_2)^2/2` 和条件 Jensen，得到

`E exp(eta X^2)<=exp(-eta)/(1-4 eta)`, `0<eta<1/4`。

若 `h=dmu/dgamma`，并采用 `P_t psi_n=t^(n/2)psi_n`，一次固定
`P_(1/2)` Mehler 预平滑、上述尾界和 centered/variance-one 的 Hermite 0--2 阶
消失给出网页端 Theorem R132-A：

`||P_t h-1||_2<8 t^(3/2)`, `0<t<=1/2`.

外层 Gaussian hypercontractivity 进一步给出

`||P_t h-1||_p<=8(p-1)^(3/2)t^(3/2)`,

`p>=2`、`t<=1/(2(p-1))`。因而 genuine all-row depth-`N` tower 的
`g_N=P_(q^N)h_N` 满足 `||g_N-1||_2<=8q^(3N/2)`，并给出
`theta<3log(1/q)/(2log3)` 范围内的 growing normalized Gram/Jacobi window。
这部分等级为 `PROVED`，但只对 all-row genuine exact class；scalar `RK=1` 尚不能
自动代入。

## 对网页推导的精确纠正

在项目参数约定下，Mehler kernel `M_s` 的正确平方范数为

`int M_s(x,y)^2 dgamma(x)=(1-s^2)^(-1/2) exp(s y^2/(1+s))`。

此前本机记录把 `(1+s)^(-1/2)` 误作精确前因子，实质是配方后漏掉了 `1-s`；
网页写出的 `(1-s^2)^(-1/2)` 才是 exact identity。此修正不改变网页随后使用
的 `||P_(1/2)h||_2<3` 和常数 `8`：在 `s=1/2` 时，精确算子因子为
`(4/3)^(1/4)`，与尾界中的 `exp(-1/6)` 合并仍小于 `1`。本机审计脚本已改为
直接核验精确前因子。

## 新的 log-density 局部桥

令 `g=P_t h`、`t<=1/64`。Mehler 正性与 Chebyshev 给出

`g(x)>=(3/4)exp(-3)exp(-x^2/63)`，

从而 `g^(-1)` 具有显式 inverse-`L^4` 控制。结合 `L^4` smoothing，得到

`||log g||_2<=C_K t^(3/2)`，

并且

`<log g,He_3/sqrt(6)>=t^(3/2)m_3(h)/sqrt(6)+O(t^3)`。

在 full exact class 中 `y_4=3`，所以

`1-beta_2(g)/2=m_3(g)^2/2=3a_3(g)^2`。

这说明 `P_3 log g` 已经能进入 fixed Jacobi 坐标，但该 fixed-level defect 只
是随振幅消失的二次量，尚不足以推出 fixed positive separation。

## 障碍与下一步

仅 positivity、mean zero、variance one 和 individual `L^2` 不能给 uniform
fixed-time smoothing；稀有远端 Gaussian mixture 是 probability-level obstruction。
R132 的 uniformity 依赖 all-row exactness 产生的 square-exponential tail。

当前唯一值得继续推进的任务是 **Same-Factor Angular-to-Jacobi Amplification**：
从 exact same-factor identity 直接寻找 `P_3K` 到 normalized Gram determinant
curvature 的 all-degree quantitative identity，或给出严格 no-go。仍不能把
`m_3=0` 写成 `P_3K=0`，也不能把 scalar `RK=1` 写成 all-row/full-`Q` law。

# 2026-09-08 — R133 首个奇阶 Jacobi 包与有限行盲区

网页端 R133 完成了一个可保留的局部结构，但本机复核补上了两个边界：其一，
“首个非零奇 Hermite/cumulant 阶数为 `d`”本身不足以推出低阶 moments 是
Gaussian，必须先从 same-factor angular identity 的偶阶系数递推得到
`kappa_4=...=kappa_{2d-2}=0`；其二，未平滑的顶层需要 `L^2`/解析性条件，
否则 first-odd Jacobi theorem 只能用于 genuine smoothed level 或条件化陈述。

在 genuine centered/variance-one analytic density、full same-factor identity
`<exp(sum_j C_g(z r_j))>_theta=1` 下，若 `d=2s+1` 是首个非零奇阶，则

`1-beta_{s+1}/(s+1)=binom(2s+1,s)a_d^2`,

并且

`D_{s+1}D_{s-1}/D_s^2-1=-binom(2s+1,s)a_d^2`。

这是唯一末端 `2x2` Hermite Gram block 的 exact determinant，加上 Jacobi
determinant dictionary 得到的 `PROVED` 局部包；对项目原始 scalar `RK=1`
仍是 `CONDITIONAL`，因为 scalar 等式尚未被证明等价于 full exact law。

若 `P_3K_sp` 按项目 convention 等价于
`ell_3=<log g,psi_3>`，非零 charge 只保证某个 first odd packet 存在，不能
保证 fixed positive gap。事实上令 `epsilon=||g-1||_2`，则
`Delta_k<4^k epsilon^2`，`k=(d+1)/2`；在
`k<=log_3(1/epsilon)` 时，`Delta_k<=epsilon^(2-log_3 4)->0`。这是一条严格
`NO-GO`：R131 subcritical window 内首个 packet 不足以关闭 separation。

网页端还给出 genuine finite-row blindness：对固定 `m>=2`，取
`f∈C_c^infty((2,3))` 消去 `0,...,2m` 次 moments，令 `g=1+lambda f`。小
`lambda` 时它是正的 centered/variance-one density，前 `m` 个 Jacobi rows
完全 Gaussian，但
`<log g,psi_3>=-lambda^2 int f^2 psi_3 dgamma/2+O(lambda^3) !=0`。
这证明任何固定有限行信息都不够，是 `PROVED OBSTRUCTION`，不是 full
same-factor exact 命题的反例。

`int M_s(x,y)^2 dgamma(x)=(1-s^2)^(-1/2) exp(s y^2/(1+s))`，

此前本机记录误写成 `(1+s)^(-1/2)`。在 `s=1/2` 时精确算子因子为
`(4/3)^(1/4)`，和尾界的 `exp(-1/6)` 合并仍小于 `1`，所以 R132 的常数
与结论不变；R132 审计脚本及路线框架已同步修正。

下一轮唯一任务更新为 **R134 Critical-Layer Same-Factor Jacobi Cascade**：
从 angular identity 推导全阶 cumulative normalized curvature 的
energy/telescoping identity，或者严格证明其 obstruction；不得重复 R133，
也不得把未经推导的 `9^m` amplification 写成结论。

# 2026-09-08 — R135 Critical Tensor-Leakage Anti-Shielding

网页端 R135 完成了当前行 tensor leakage 的精确审计。本轮不把网页内容直接当
作事实：先读取 `main@1a3f851`，再用本机 `F:\anaconda3\python.exe`
运行 `r135_tensor_leakage_audit/audit_r135.py` 复核有限公式和常数。

本机 marker：

`R135_HIDDEN_BLOCK_SHIELDING_PASSED`

`R135_FIRST_LOWER_LAYER_NORMALIZATION_PASSED`

`R135_CUBIC_HESSIAN_PASSED`

`R135_CRITICAL_LAYER_SCALE_PASSED`

`R135_AUDIT_COMPLETED`

可保留的严格结果如下。对 genuine probability law，`rho_(n,theta)` 是
`<E,(I-P_<n)E>` 的正投影二次型；其 total-degree `n-1` 分量是
`T_(n-1,theta)/n` 乘以一个显式条件方差加均值偏差平方。该结果只需要有限矩，
并不需要把 scalar `RK=1` 识别为 full-SF。

更强的有限层 obstruction 取 `d=2n-1`。用 `x^d` 对
`span{x^r:0<=r<=2n,r!=d}` 的 `L^1(gamma)` 最佳逼近的符号函数构造
`g_epsilon=1+epsilon sign(x^d-v_*)`。它严格正、centered、variance-one，
且 `||g_epsilon-1||_2=epsilon`；到 `2n` 阶 only hidden odd coordinate
survives，所以 SF 只需到 `2n` 阶就精确成立。此时

`rho_n=Delta_n(p_(2n)-p_(2n-1)^2)`、
`sigma_n=Delta_n p_(2n-1)^2`、
`Delta_n=binom(2n-1,n-1)a_(2n-1)^2`，

并有 `rho/(rho+sigma)>=1-(2/3)^(n-2)`。取 `epsilon=3^(-n)` 后，
`n=log_3(1/epsilon)`，而 `Delta_n<(4/9)^n`；所以在精确 critical layer，
当前行可被 tensor leakage 几乎完全 shielding，同时可见 normalized curvatures
趋于零。这不是原始 all-degree 命题反例，因为缺少未来 degree 的 SF completion。

因此 R135 的判决是：

* `PROVED`：精确投影二次型、首层条件方差、finite-SF near-total shielding、
  `lambda_n` 指数抵消、fixed-`n` cubic Hessian `5n(n-1)/48`；
* `CONDITIONAL`：scalar `RK=1` 到 full-SF/all-row 的接口；
* `OBSTRUCTION`：当前行 `rho` 的 uniform anti-shielding、固定比例 predictor
  控制、以及 `lambda_n^{-1}` 作为独立 exponential lower gain；
* `OPEN`：near-total finite prefix 是否具有 genuine all-degree one-body SF
  completion。

# 2026-09-08 — R136 Full-SF 形式完成与 genuine 全阶边界

网页端 R136 将 R135 的 finite-prefix 问题提升为 full same-factor 形式生成函数
审计。本机新增 `r136_full_sf_formal_audit/README.md` 与 `audit_r136.py`，命令
`F:\\anaconda3\\python.exe r136_full_sf_formal_audit\\audit_r136.py` 已通过：

`R136_PARITY_AND_EVEN_PIVOT_PASSED`

`R136_FIRST_FUTURE_BAND_PASSED`

`R136_EXPLICIT_FUTURE_COEFFICIENTS_PASSED`

`R136_SPARSE_SUPPORT_PASSED`

`R136_BOCHNER_BOUNDARY_RECORDED`

`R136_AUDIT_COMPLETED`

可保留的核心结果是。设 `C(z)=sum_(m>=3)c_m z^m`，

`F_C(z)=<exp(sum_m c_m p_m(theta)z^m)>_theta=1`。

由于 `theta -> theta+pi`，奇总次数角平均恒为零；而偶次数最新变量的系数

`A_(2N)=<p_(2N)>=3 binom(2N,N)/6^N`

严格为正。因此任意 odd formal sequence 都有唯一的 even formal completion。
这是 `FORMAL-PROVED`，但不声称级数收敛或对应 genuine probability law。

若 `d` 是首个非零 odd degree，则 `2d<=M<4d` 内有精确 first-future-band

`A_M c_M + 1/2 sum_(a+b=M, odd a,b>=d) B_(a,b)c_a c_b=0`。

首项 `c_(2d)<0`，但 `2d+2` 起出现 `c_d c_(d+2)` mixed term，符号不再固定；
只保留 `c_d` 时形式支撑为 `2kd`，没有 coefficientwise sign contradiction。
因此 full-SF/Jacobi coefficient algebra 不能单独给出 odd-zero rigidity，
也不能提供此前设想的正级联。

R136 的第二个小里程碑是有限截断 genuine realization：固定 `M` 时，利用消去
`psi_0,psi_1,psi_2` 的紧支撑有界双函数和小振幅，可以实现任意有限形式 jet
为 smooth strictly positive centered variance-one `L^2(gamma)` density。阈值
依赖 `M`，所以这不是单个 all-degree counterexample；Bochner positive
definiteness、uniform Hankel/Jacobi positivity、解析增长和统一密度仍为 OPEN。

角平均密度的相对熵 `S(z)=D(uniform||sigma_z)>=0` 也不能恢复逐项符号，因非负
解析函数的 Taylor 系数无需非负。任何更强的 Szego/Hankel 表示必须先核验其
测度与正则性范围。

本轮判决：local rowwise anti-shielding = `NO-GO`；all-degree coefficientwise
SF/Jacobi algebra = `NO-GO`；finite-cutoff positive realization = `PROVED`；
global genuine all-degree completion = `OPEN`；scalar `RK=1` 到 full-SF 接口
仍是 `CONDITIONAL`。

下一轮发送网页端 **R137 Uniform Genuine-Realization Breakdown**：证明随 cutoff
增大 positivity/Bochner/Hankel 常数必崩溃，或构造 cutoff-uniform realization
并完成 Bochner 与 all-degree SF 检查。要求网页端先读取最新 Git 提交和本节，再
从“R136 方向 A”未完的 Hankel/Jacobi uniform breakdown 分支继续，不重复已经
判定为 no-go 的局部估计。

R135 将总路线从“控制当前行 `rho`”推进到唯一剩余问题：
**R136 Full-SF Leakage Extension Rigidity**。下一轮必须研究全阶 positive
sum rule 或严格的 all-degree completion obstruction；不得把 finite prefix
称作原命题反例。

# 2026-09-08 — R137 固定 sparse branch 的 Hankel 半径坍缩

网页端 R137 完成了 R136 未展开的方向 A，并先审计了自身量词：square-exponential
tail 足以使 MGF entire，有限 odd cumulant support 给出 odd polynomial；由
`M(t)>=1` 与 `M(t)<=2 exp(-1/8)exp(2t^2)` 得
`|K_o(t)|<=K_e(t)<=2t^2+log 2-1/8`，所以 centered 情形的有限 odd support
只能全部为零。该 theorem 的证据等级为 `PROVED`；SF 在应用中负责提供 R132
的全阶 tail，而不是把 scalar `RK=1` 自动升级为 full-SF。

固定 `d=2s+1>=5`、`c_d=a`、其余 odd formal cumulants为零。由
`kappa_d=d!a` 和首个 Jacobi packet，直接核验
`det H_(s+1)=(prod_(j=0)^s j!)[1-d!binom(d,s)a^2]`，故
`|a|<=R_d=[d!binom(d,s)]^(-1/2)`。本机新增
`r137_uniform_realization_audit/`，脚本命令
`F:\\anaconda3\\python.exe r137_uniform_realization_audit\\audit_r137.py`。

定义 `I_M^H(d)` 为 formal order-M Hankel PSD 可行集，`I_M^+(d)` 为 genuine
strictly-positive centered variance-one finite-jet 可行集。`I_(M+1)^H subset
I_M^H` 且 `I_M^+ subset I_M^H`。若固定 `a!=0` 属于所有 Hankel 前缀，Hamburger
表示测度加 formal SF coefficient identities 给出 `E Q^r=2^r r!`；R132
Carleman/差分桥给 square-exponential tail，再与 finite-odd rigidity 矛盾。因此
`intersection_M I_M^H(d)={0}`。闭嵌套紧性推出
`rho_M(d)=max{|a|:a in I_M^H(d)} down 0`，以及 genuine 最大可行半径
`rho_M^+(d)<=rho_M(d)->0`。这是一条 construction-independent 的 fixed-d
全阶可行性半径结论，但不是 first failing minor 的显式阶。

R137 还明确：若 `sup_M ||g_M||_p<infty`（`p>1`）或有统一
square-exponential moment，则有限 jets 可抽取 all-moment genuine 极限；要将
formal SF 解释为 analytic pointwise identity，仍需统一解析尾条件。低阶
`3x3` Bochner minor 对 hidden `d>=5` 只在约 `a^2t^(2d)` 才敏感，故是
`OBSTRUCTION` 而非 global no-go。

当前分层：`PROVED` 为 finite odd-support rigidity、fixed-d Hankel radius
collapse、uniform compactness interface；`CONDITIONAL` 为 scalar `RK=1` 到
full-SF/all-row；`OPEN` 只剩 infinitely-many-odd-tail 的 genuine Bochner
realization。固定 n selector、`d_n->infty,a_n->0` 序列、单个 all-degree law
仍严格分开。下一轮网页任务为 **R138 — Infinite-Odd-Tail Bochner Phase
Rigidity**。

# 2026-09-08 — R138 infinite odd tail / Bochner phase audit

网页端 R138 已恢复并完成；本机新增 `r138_infinite_tail_bochner_audit/`，脚本
`F:\\anaconda3\\python.exe r138_infinite_tail_bochner_audit\\audit_r138.py`
通过：

`R138_EVEN_PIVOT_PASSED`

`R138_ZERO_DIVISOR_PARITY_PASSED`

`R138_FINITE_ZERO_TOP_TERM_PASSED`

`R138_GAUSSIAN_BOCHNER_MINOR_PASSED`

`R138_ZERO_FREE_DISK_CONSTANT_PASSED`

`R138_COMPACTNESS_PARAMETER_PASSED`

`R138_AUDIT_COMPLETED`

本机审计保留并收紧网页端的主要结论。对 square-exponential genuine law，
ordinary MGF 是 order 至多二的 entire function，genus-two Hadamard 分解给
`kappa_m=-(m-1)! sum zeta^(-m)`。按零点重数定义最小非配对半径 `R_Delta`，
有限 reciprocal-zero exponential sum 的 Cesaro mean square 给出
`limsup_(m odd)(|kappa_m|/(m-1)!)^(1/m)=1/R_Delta`。故 finite odd support 和
超指数 normalized odd tail 被排除；普通指数衰减不能仅靠此机制排除。

full-SF 的 Jensen/Fisher 审计给出 `E(x)<=x^2`、安全预算
`int_0^T|O''|<=8T+(log 2-1/8)/T`，以及 resummed odd-charge bound
`sum_r|Q_r(t)|^2<=exp(t^2/2)(1-exp(-S(t)))`。后者只控制 Fourier 重求和，
不提供逐个 cumulant 的正性，因此无限 tail 的 cancellation 仍是精确缺口。

Bochner small-frequency leading term、hidden degree 的首个敏感矩阵和
cutoff-uniform compactness 均通过独立有限检查；Gaussian `0,t,2t` minor 的
精确开头为 `2t^6-4t^8+O(t^10)`。有限固定节点测试仍属 `OBSTRUCTION`，不能
升级为 global no-go。

本轮新的 tower 结论是：在 genuine full-SF/all-row 假设下，R132 的统一
`|z|<=1/4` zero-free disk 与 OU normalized Bargmann scaling，使 single bottom
law 的 all-depth genuine backward preimages 必为 Gaussian。这一结论对
incompatible moving-top towers 不适用；`d_N->infty,a_N->0` 仍是 OPEN。由
scalar `RK=1` 到 genuine full-SF/all-row，以及回到 spatial `P_3 K_sp` 的接口
继续标为 `CONDITIONAL`。

当前 OPEN 已压缩为：是否存在具有 infinitely many nonzero odd cumulants、
无限 asymmetric MGF zero divisor 且满足 full-SF 与 Bochner positive
definiteness 的 genuine law。下一轮发送网页端 **R139 — infinite zero-divisor
phase rigidity / cross-degree Bochner majorization**，只寻找跨所有 Fourier
charges 的正定性不等式；若失败，明确写出 cancellation witness 和最小 global
gap。不得把 R138 的 formal/finite-cutoff 结果写成 genuine non-Gaussian law。

# 2026-09-08 — R139 zero-divisor phase / cross-charge audit

网页端 R139 已完成长篇推导。本机新增
`r139_zero_phase_cross_charge_audit/`，并将结果分为 genuine、formal 和
conditional 三层。审计保留的主要 genuine-level 推进是：

1. 按 `zeta -> -zeta` 的 signed divisor 先合并重数后，最小非配对壳的
   Cesaro mean-square 严格为正，得到 odd-cumulant root-limsup 与
   `R_Delta` 的精确对应；逐阶下界仍被共轭壳 cancellation witness 否定。
2. 在 `R_Delta<infty` 下，非对称 square-exponential law 的 odd cumulants
   必有无限多个正值和无限多个负值。这里 Pringsheim 的使用依赖 odd Taylor
   半径有限，不能推广到 entire odd series。
3. full-SF Fisher identity 升级为
   `sum_r(|Q_r'|^2+9r^2|Q_r|^2/t^2)<=exp(t^2/2)`；不同 angular charges
   在该能量中正交，唯一已定位的逃逸是同一 `Q_r` 内的跨 degree cancellation。
4. hidden degree `d=2s+1` 的首敏感 Bochner/Hankel 尺寸为 `(d+3)/2`。
   任意有限测试族仍能在足够小的 genuine finite-prefix 扰动中完全隐身，
   这不是 full-SF law 或 relaxed Hankel counterexample。
5. 得到一个新的 genuine probability-level lemma：full-SF 且所有高阶偶
   累积量非负时必 Gaussian；故 square-exponential infinitely divisible
   full-SF law 也必 Gaussian。

R139 没有构造 genuine non-Gaussian full-SF law。`CONDITIONAL` 仍包括 scalar
`RK=1 -> full-SF/all-row` 以及 ordinary MGF/Bargmann 结论到 spatial
`P_3 K_sp`。当前 `OPEN` 仍是无限非配对零点除子问题和 incompatible moving-top
backward towers。下一轮只攻 first-shell 到 real-axis energy 的反向 coercive
lower bound；若失败，写出更精确的 cancellation obstruction。

# 2026-09-08 — R140 gap/separation shell-to-energy audit

网页端 R140 已在同一“数学定理证明 — 理论推进审计”对话完成，并按公开仓库
提交 `5569c32c41e2ff078cb4d7e7d25479e170d7d028` 读取 R139 基线。本机新增
`r140_gap_separation_shell_audit/README.md` 与 `audit_r140.py`，记录了：

1. R139 的严格更正：Pringsheim 依赖有限 odd Taylor 半径；`(d+3)/2` 只是
   首个 Hankel-leading sensitive size，`3x3` direct odd phase 可在 `h^(2d)`
   进入；even-cumulant cone 的量词是所有 `m>=2`。
2. 在 first-shell angular separation、outer radial gap 和 weighted tail 有
   明确界时，shifted Cesàro block + finite Gram 给出 `E(T)>=Psi>0`。本机
   利用 odd tail 的步长 2 核验了网页回答中的 denominator 8 版本：
   `||tail||_2<=4B*tau^(M+5/2)/((M+2)*sqrt(2M+5))`，因此
   `tau^2<=a*sqrt(h_M)*(M+2)*sqrt(2M+5)/(8B)` 足以提供半量余度。与 full-SF upper budget 合并后，
   `Psi>U(T)` 可排除该 regular-shell geometry class；这是带假设的
   `PROVED`，不是 universal `(R_Delta,V_Delta)` gap。
3. Bernoulli+Gaussian 的 angular-coalescence 族和
   `B_p-cB_p'`+Gaussian 的 radial-coalescence 族说明：即使 genuine Bochner、
   固定 `R_Delta,V_Delta`，没有 angular/radial uniform gap 时 bounded-window
   energy 仍可趋零。它们不是 full-SF counterexamples。
4. full-SF `3x3` triangle 给出
   `3<|phi(rho t cos(theta))|^2> <= 1+2e^(-t^2/2)` 的 modulus/even
   majorization；它不能直接提供非配对零点 phase 的反向 gap。

## R141 — Renormalized zero-shell Bochner phase compactness（2026-09-08）

网页端已读取 R140 提交 `32f86ddb2d7b21b9dfaec7027dd49b987d2d34a0`，并确认 R140
的 odd-block 步长 2 与 denominator 8 的尾界一致：
`||tail||_2<=4B*tau^(M+5/2)/((M+2)*sqrt(2M+5))`。本机审计目录为
`r141_normalized_zero_shell_audit/`，其中 `README.md` 保存完整理论记录，
`audit_r141.py` 只做有限代数/标度/最大值/塔深度接口检查。

本轮得到的可复用小里程碑是：在 `J<=J0、sigma>=sigma0、Gamma>=Gamma0、
B3<=b*sqrt(V)` 的显式 regular normalized shell 类中，
`mathfrak Q_r(s)=-iQ_r(iR_Delta*s/rho)` 的归一化 odd-ratio phase 具有统一的
非零局部 `L2` 下界，并形成单位圆盘内的 normal family。OU 变换保持归一化零点
和 phase，却把 raw characteristic 乘以
`exp(-(1-lambda)R_Delta^2*s^2/(2lambda))`；因此 raw Bochner gap 不能直接
升级为 scale-free gap。相对 Gaussian 的 `B_mu=exp(-z^2/2)M` 是正确的
OU-invariant 形状变量，但其 positive-definite 性未解决。

此外，若第一 hidden odd degree 是 `d`，则有限秩 Gram 的 imaginary part 受
`epsilon_d(lambda)<=2exp(-1/8)*(4lambda/(1-lambda))^(d/2)` 控制；节点分离的
Gaussian damping 进一步说明固定/次临界 rank 会看不见 O(1) odd phase。对
backward tower，这一盲区对应 `Gaussian-relative spectral-rank escape`，而非
对 genuine non-Gaussian full-SF law 的构造。

分级保持严格：`PROVED` 仅含带假设的 normalized L2 gap、OU 标度接口、raw
damping、finite-rank erasure 与既有兼容塔结果；`CONDITIONAL` 仍含 scalar
`RK=1` 到 full-SF/all-row 和 ordinary MGF/Bargmann 到 spatial `P_3K_sp`；
`OPEN` 是 Gaussian-relative positive quadratic form 的构造，或证明其谱特征值
必然衰减。下一轮唯一任务为 **R142 — Gaussian-Relative / Semiclassical
Bochner Spectral Amplification**，重点研究节点间距 `~sqrt(lambda)`、rank
增长、confluent/high-order normalization 以及 Gaussian-relative 正二次型。

---

## R142 — Semiclassical Gaussian-relative Bochner amplification（2026-09-08）

网页端已读取并锁定提交 `ec8ceb40741ad187a87dc4b046bc71a0cecfec7e`，并完成
R141/R140 基线核验。本机审计目录为 `r142_gaussian_relative_spectral_audit/`，
其中 `README.md` 保存完整推导，`audit_r142.py` 只验证有限 algebraic/scaling
interfaces，不替代 form-level 或 semiclassical 分析证明。

本轮真正的新结果是：对 `K_tilde_(lambda,R)(u,v)=phi_lambda(R(u-v))` 与
`G_R(u,v)=exp(-R^2(u-v)^2/2)`，Gaussian-relative generalized form
`A_lambda=G_R^(-1/2)K_tilde G_R^(-1/2)` 在 Gaussian spectral representation
中是 multiplication by `g_lambda=dmu_lambda/dgamma`，所以在 form domain 保持
真正 positivity。normalized coherent vector 给出
`<k_(y/(2sqrt(lambda))),A_lambda k_(y/(2sqrt(lambda)))>=B_mu(y)`；这意味着
R141 被 raw characteristic damping 隐藏的 OU-invariant real Bargmann shape
可以无误差恢复。

同时，`x_j=sqrt(lambda)u_j` 的两节点 odd entry 为 `O(lambda^(d/2))`，raw
2-point/3-point direct effect 为 `O(lambda^d)`；Gaussian Gram 小特征值按
阶乘尾和衰减。Hermite/confluent block 在 `n lambda->tau` 时精确趋于
`T_r(B_mu(2sqrt(tau)cos(theta)))`，固定 hidden degree 需要 `n~lambda^(-1)`
才能恢复 O(1) signal。谱放大因此真实存在，并且可以保持 positivity。

但 canonical Toeplitz symbol 在实轴严格为正，对任意 genuine probability law
都自动成立；所以这条正性本身是 non-coercive 的。复 coherent off-diagonal
仍有 `exp(-y^2/(2lambda))` 阻尼，固定/次临界 rank 不能恢复 characteristic
phase。一个足够闭合的条件是 `B_mu(y)B_mu(-y)>=1` 全实轴；与 genuine full-SF
结合可推出 Gaussian，但 full-SF 自动给出该条件仍未证明。

对 tower，`g_N=P_(q^N)h_N` 的 positive coherent quotient 在
`|z|~q^(-N/2)` 恢复 top shape，Hermite energy 为 `n~q^(-N)`；现有 exact/Jacobi
控制为 `O(N)`，构成明确的 linear-versus-exponential spectral gap。因而 R142
排除了“OU smoothing 让 odd shape 消失”的解释，但尚未排除高能 coherent/tensor
escape。严格状态为：本轮获得一个可独立报告的
**Semiclassical Gaussian-Relative Bochner Amplification Theorem**，但没有构造
genuine non-Gaussian full-SF law，也没有闭合 Positive Backward-Tower 总命题。

下一轮唯一任务为 **R143 — Coherent-State Tensor Positivity / Even-Sector
Closure**：研究 coherent kernel
`C_mu(z,w)=exp(conj(z)w-(|z|^2+|w|^2)/2)B_mu(conj(z)+w)` 的 tensor/frame
正性，判断能否得到 `B(y)B(-y)>=1` 或等价 even-sector domination；若不能，
给出 infinite-rank coherent PSD 层面的严格 cancellation witness。仍保持
`RK=1` 桥接和 spatial `P_3K_sp` 接口为 `CONDITIONAL/OPEN`。

## R143 — Coherent-frame tensor positivity / even-sector closure（2026-09-08）

网页端在公开提交 `e16d79105cf430d9ce9381e85ccbd71cd6479646` 的 R142 基线上
完成 R143，并按八段结构收束。R143 没有构造 genuine non-Gaussian full-SF
probability law，也没有证明其不存在；`RK=1` 到 genuine full-SF/all-row 与
从 `B_mu/C_g` 到 spatial `P_3K_sp=0` 继续标为 `CONDITIONAL/OPEN`。

### 一、R142 审计收束

R142 的 Fourier forms

`q_K(f)=int |f_hat(Rx)|^2 dmu_lambda(x)`、
`q_G(f)=int |f_hat(Rx)|^2 dgamma(x)`

在 Schwartz/form domain 上保持正确。`A_lambda` 应理解为 closed quadratic-form
relative normalization；`G_R^(-1/2)` 与可能的 `M_(g_lambda)` 不能无条件视为
bounded operators。R142 script markers 只认证有限 algebra/scaling interfaces，
不替代无限维 domain、局部一致收敛或 Hermite–Toeplitz 分析证明。coherent
identity 与实轴 Rayleigh recovery 保持：

`<k_z,A_lambda k_w>`
`=exp(conj(z)w-(|z|^2+|w|^2)/2)B_(mu_lambda)(conj(z)+w)`,

`<k_(y/(2sqrt(lambda))),A_lambda k_(y/(2sqrt(lambda)))>=B_mu(y)`。

### 二、coherent kernel 的精确 PSD 域

R143 直接使用

`C_mu(z,w)=exp(conj(z)w-(|z|^2+|w|^2)/2)B_mu(conj(z)+w)`
`=int overline(k_z(x))k_w(x)dmu(x)`。

对 square-exponential genuine law，此式在整个 `C x C` 上成立；任意有限二次型

`sum_(i,j)conj(c_i)c_j C_mu(z_i,z_j)`
`=int |sum_j c_jk_(z_j)(x)|^2dmu(x)>=0`。

因此 `C_mu` 与任意 `C_mu^(tensor m)` 都是 genuine PSD；局部参数导数块在
Gaussian triangular basis 下回到 Hermite/Hankel blocks。`C_mu=C_gamma circ D_mu`
不能通过 Schur division 推出 `D_mu=B_mu(conj(z)+w)` PSD。

### 三、full-SF tensor identity 与新小里程碑

取 `r_j(theta)=sqrt(2/3)cos(theta+2pi(j-1)/3)` 与
`V_t(theta)=tensor_j k_(t r_j(theta)/2)`，则

`F_t(theta)=||V_t(theta)||^2=prod_j B_mu(t r_j(theta))`、`<F_t>=1`。

角自相关的精确式是

`<V_t(alpha+delta/2),V_t(alpha-delta/2)>`
`=exp(-t^2(1-cos(delta))/4)F_(t cos(delta/2))(alpha)`。

full-SF 平均后，角 Fourier modes
`V_(t,n)=(2pi)^(-1)int V_t(theta)exp(-in theta)dtheta` 满足

`||V_(t,n)||^2=exp(-t^2/4)I_n(t^2/4)`。

循环置换给出不同 `n mod 3` block 的正交性。对
`S_t=(2pi)^(-1)int |V_t(theta)><V_t(theta)|dtheta`，有

`Tr(S_t^2)-exp(-t^2/2)I_0(t^2/2)`
`=sum_(n!=m,n=m mod 3)|<V_(t,n),V_(t,m)>|^2>=0`。

若某个 `t>0` 等号成立，则方差项消失，实解析性给出 `F_s(theta)=1` 于区间
成立，继而 `B_mu=1`、`mu=gamma`。本轮独立小里程碑命名为
**Coherent-Frame Bessel Spectrum and Purity-Defect Theorem**：full-SF 固定
所有 mode energies 为 Gaussian，非 Gaussianity只能位于同一 `mod 3` sector
的 cross-harmonic coherence，而这些 coherence 的总平方正是 positive
frame-purity excess。

### 四、even-sector closure

普通 coherent antipodal `2x2` minor 为

`[[B(y),exp(-y^2/2)],[exp(-y^2/2),B(-y)]]>=0`，

只能推出 `B(y)B(-y)>=exp(-y^2)`。需要的闭合条件是
`[[B(y),1],[1,B(-y)]]>=0`，即 `B(y)B(-y)>=1`。若额外加入该条件，
`C_e>=0` 与 `1=<exp(H_e)cosh(H_o)>` 立即强制 `B=1`；这是真正的
conditional closure theorem。

R133/R136 的 first-packet identity 同时给出相反方向的局部审计：若 hypothetical
non-Gaussian full-SF law 的首个非零 log-degree 为 odd `d`，则

`log(B(y)B(-y))=-(<p_d^2>/A_(2d))c_d^2y^(2d)+O(y^(2d+2))<0`。

所以 `B(y)B(-y)>=1` 不是 ordinary coherent positivity 可自动产生的温和
结论；它若成立会直接解决大命题。

### 五、严格 obstruction

`C_mu=C_gamma circ D_mu` 的 Schur quotient 不保 PSD。operator-level witness
`T_epsilon=I-epsilon(|e_0><f_6|+|f_6><e_0|)`（`0<epsilon<1`）严格正、保持
`D_3` 对称并有 Gaussian radial Q-average，但保留 `cos(6theta)` anisotropy。
这是严格的 positive coherent cancellation witness，但不是 scalar full-SF law。

probability-level witness 取二维 `Z=R(cos Theta,sin Theta)`，其中
`R^2~chi^2_2`、`dP_Theta=(1+epsilon cos(6theta))dtheta/(2pi)`。它保持
Gaussian radial law、协方差 `I_2`、`D_3` 对称和 common-rotation identities，
但 `epsilon<0` 时坐标有 `B(y)B(-y)<1`。它不是 iid residual scalar law，故不
冒充 full-SF counterexample；它只证明 radius/symmetry/common-rotation 数据
不足，真正缺的结构是 iid one-dimensional ridge-product factorization。

### 六、rank / semiclassical 节点族

固定 coherent Gram 只给自动 PSD；imaginary pair 的 off-diagonal 仍为
`exp(-y^2/(2lambda))B_mu(iy)`；相邻 overlap 有固定下界的 coherent chain 需
`m_lambda>=|y|/(C sqrt(lambda))`；Hermite/confluent block 需
`n lambda->tau`，即 `n~lambda^(-1)`，才能把 fixed odd signal 放回 `O(1)`。
但 canonical Toeplitz limit 仍为自动正的
`T_r(B_mu(2sqrt(tau)cos theta))`。无限 rank 只保证 identifiability，不保证
positive coercivity。必须继续区分 direct `3x3` phase `~h^(2d)` 与 first
Hankel-leading sensitive size `(d+3)/2`。

### 七、Positive Backward Tower

对 `g_N=P_(q^N)h_N`，R142 的 positive form 在
`|z|~q^(-N/2)` 精确恢复 `B_(h_N)`，对应 Hermite energy `n~q^(-N)`。R143
进一步说明 mode energy 并非逃逸；真正剩下的是同一 `mod 3` block 的
off-diagonal coherence，故命名为
`exponential-energy residual angular cross-coherence escape`。若 iid
factorization 能让 cross terms 消失，或推出
`Tr(S_t^2)<=exp(-t^2/2)I_0(t^2/2)`，便与 R143 的 `>=` 合成 purity equality，
可排除 genuine full-SF class 的 incompatible towers。compatible single
infinite tower 仍由 R138 独立解决，spatial `P_3K_sp` 桥仍未闭合。

### 八、分级与下一轮

`PROVED`：全复域 coherent measure Gram、tensor PSD、Gaussian Bessel mode
spectrum、`S_3` blocks、purity defect/equality rigidity、普通 reflection
minor 的精确阈值、first non-Gaussian local even reversal。

`CONDITIONAL`：scalar `RK=1` 桥接、Bargmann 到 spatial bridge、deconvolved
even domination、iid ridge-product 消灭 cross-coherence。

`OBSTRUCTION`：Schur deconvolution 非正、full-SF 固定 energy 但不固定
cross-coherence、complex overlap damping，以及 operator/probability witnesses。

`OPEN`：genuine non-Gaussian full-SF law 的存在性与 iid ridge-product residual
angular rigidity。下一轮唯一任务为 **R144 — IID Ridge-Product Residual
Angular Rigidity / Bispectrum Coherence**。

## R144 — IID ridge-product / bispectrum balanced-symmetrization no-go（2026-09-08）

### 一、工作目标与边界

本轮承接 R143 的结论：full-SF 只固定 coherent-frame 的 Gaussian mode
energy，剩余非 Gaussianity落在同一 `mod 3` sector 的 cross-harmonic
coherence。R144 不再把任意 `D_3` angular witness 当作 scalar iid 候选，而是
强制使用一维 characteristic function 的三 ridge-product lift。所有涉及
`RK=1` 到 genuine full-SF/all-row 的桥接继续标作 conditional；本轮没有
构造 genuine non-Gaussian full-SF law。

### 二、三 ridge 几何与 exact local PDE

在 `U=(X_1-X_2)/sqrt(2)`、`V=(X_1+X_2-2X_3)/sqrt(6)` 下，

`a=u/sqrt(2)+v/sqrt(6)`、`b=-u/sqrt(2)+v/sqrt(6)`、
`c=-2v/sqrt(6)`，故 `a+b+c=0`、`a^2+b^2+c^2=u^2+v^2`。对
`Phi=phi(a)phi(b)phi(c)` 的局部对数 `L`，120-degree ridge directions
给出

`(partial_u^3-3partial_u partial_v^2)L=0`。

这是真实的 iid-lift PDE，但不提供单独的正定性或全局 rigidity。

### 三、bispectrum mixed derivatives 与 weighted cocycle

令 `k=log phi`、`ell(a,b)=k(a)+k(b)+k(-a-b)`，则

`ell_ab=k''(-a-b)`、`ell_aa-ell_ab=k''(a)`、
`ell_bb-ell_ab=k''(b)`，并且

`partial_a^p partial_b^q ell(0,0)
 =(-1)^(p+q)i^(p+q)kappa_(p+q)` (`p,q>=1`)。

另外

`beta(a,b)beta(a+b,c)|phi(b+c)|^2`
`=beta(a,b+c)beta(b,c)|phi(a+b)|^2`。

该式记录 phase/cocycle compatibility；在非零域仍然缺少把 cocycle 转成
one-dimensional Bochner coercivity 的机制。

### 四、主定理：IID Balanced-Convolution Defect

令

`Y_m=(sum X_j-sum X'_j)/sqrt(2m)`，

则 `psi_m(s)=|phi(s/sqrt(2m))|^(2m)`。定义

`G_t(theta)=exp(t^2/2)prod_j phi(t r_j(theta))`。

在 genuine full-SF 假设下 `<G_t>=1`，于是

`R_(Y_m)(sqrt(2m)t)=<|G_t|^(2m)>=1` 加上非负 defect。

`L^p` 单调性给出 `||G_t||_(2m)^(1/(2m))` 上升到 `||G_t||_infinity`。
`m=1` 更精确地满足

`R_(Y_1)(sqrt(2)t)-1=<|G_t-1|^2>`
`=sum_(ell!=0)|g_(3ell)(t)|^2`。

因此 balanced convolution 的方向是 `>=1`，不是目标的 `<=1`。首个 odd
packet 给出严格正的 leading coefficient
`2^(-d)c_d^2<p_d^2>s^(2d)`。这是一项真正的 probability-level no-go：
它排除了“增加 balanced convolution/tensor power 就自动产生反向 defect”这条
闭合路线，同时保留了条件式结论——若某个 `Y_m` 另行满足 full-SF，则只能
在 equality 下 Gaussian。

### 五、与 R143 的精确桥

R143 的
`F_t(theta)=prod_j B_mu(t r_j(theta))=sum f_k(t)e^(iktheta)` 与 R144 的
`G_t` 由 `G_t=F_(it)`、`g_k(t)=f_k(it)` 相连。故两轮追踪的是同一
`3Z` harmonic family 的不同参数轴：R143 是 real-axis Gaussian/Bessel
transform 后的 coherent purity；R144 是 characteristic-axis 的 Fourier
energy。两者在 first odd packet 上同样是正能量，不存在可以直接拿来闭合的
反号。

### 六、tower 与真正剩余缺口

`G_(P_lambda mu,t)=G_(mu,sqrt(lambda)t)`、
`Delta_m^(P_lambda mu)(t)=Delta_m^mu(sqrt(lambda)t)`，故
`Delta_m^(g_N)(q^(-N/2)t)=Delta_m^(h_N)(t)`。bottom convergence 只是把
anisotropy 搬到 `q^(-N/2)` characteristic scale、`q^(-N)` Hermite scale；
compatible single infinite tower 的 R138 结论不等于 moving-top incompatible
tower 已解决。最后的 spatial `P_3 K_sp` 桥也仍未闭合。

### 七、分级与下一轮

`PROVED`：三 ridge coordinate/PDE、mixed derivative collapse、weighted
cocycle、balanced-convolution defect、`m=1` L2 identity、first odd strict
positivity、R143 harmonic bridge、OU scaling。

`CONDITIONAL`：`RK=1` 的 genuine full-SF 桥、Bargmann/characteristic 到 spatial
桥、reverse convolution bound、iid liftability closure。

`OBSTRUCTION`：ordinary Bochner 只有 modulus-weighted bound；balanced 路线
方向相反；analytic continuation 不保正定；一般 angular witness 不
是 iid scalar law。

`OPEN`：positive-definite one-dimensional `phi` 的 shifted/iid ridge lift 是否
被 Gaussian circular mean 强制为 Gaussian，以及该结论能否沿 backward tower
uniform 化。下一轮为 **R145 — Shifted Bispectrum / Common-Mode–Residual
Coupling Rigidity**，首次离开 `s=0` residual plane，使用 full 3D positive
kernel。应同时完成全历史与发表性审计；若没有独立、完整、可审稿的成果，必须
明确回答“无”，不得把形式计算、条件结论或有限脚本审计包装成发表定理。

## R145 — Shifted Bispectrum / Common–Residual Regression（2026-09-08）

网页端先读取了公开提交 `4e31ab30930609b7ee18e552897d0116312a8e55` 的
Framework、Worklog、R144 README 与脚本，并完成从早期路线到 R144 的全历史与
发表性审计。严格结论为：

`无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）`。

R145 仍然有真实 probability-level 推进，但目前更准确的定位是主问题中的
lemma package，而非独立投稿定理。记录在
`r145_shifted_bispectrum_common_mode_audit/README.md`，有限代数核验在同目录
`audit_r145.py`。

### 本轮 exact setup

`C=(X_1+X_2+X_3)/sqrt(3)`、`U=(X_1-X_2)/sqrt(2)`、
`V=(X_1+X_2-2X_3)/sqrt(6)`，

`a_1=u/sqrt(2)+v/sqrt(6)`、`a_2=-u/sqrt(2)+v/sqrt(6)`、
`a_3=-2v/sqrt(6)`，`Psi(s;u,v)=prod_j phi(s/sqrt(3)+a_j(u,v))`。

沿 `v=0` 的 mixed-cumulant identity 是

`partial_s^(m-2)partial_u^2 log Psi(0)`
`=3^(-(m-2)/2)i^m kappa_m`，

即 `cum(C,...,C,U,U)=3^(-(m-2)/2)kappa_m`。这确认 common-mode coupling
精确承载 higher cumulants，但没有自动消失。

### 新的 common-mode/residual inequality

finite 3D Bochner Gram 对 iid characteristic function分解为三个一维 Gram 的
Hadamard product；四节点 Schur complement 只给 mixed dependence 的平方上界。
若 genuine full-SF/all-row 已知 `R^2=U^2+V^2~chi^2_2`，令

`A(s,t)=E[exp(i s C)J_0(tR)]`，则严格有

`|A(s,t)-phi(s/sqrt(3))^3 exp(-t^2/2)|^2`
`<= (1-|phi(s/sqrt(3))|^6) exp(-t^2)(I_0(t^2)-1)`。

`t->0` 给出无除法的约束

`|phi(x)|^2|phi(x)^2+phi(x)phi''(x)-phi'(x)^2|^2<=1-|phi(x)|^6`。

它比 R144 的 residual-only information 更强，但方向仍是上界。

### Appell regression theorem and closure interface

置 `H(C)=E[R^2-2|C]`，并用
`exp(tC)/E exp(tC)=sum P_n^C(C)t^n/n!` 定义 sample-mean 的
cumulant-Appell polynomials，则

`E[H(C)P_n^C(C)] = 2 3^(-n/2)kappa_(n+2)`，`n>=1`。

也就是说，全部 higher cumulants 是条件样本方差回归缺陷的 Appell 坐标。
`E[R^2|C]=2` a.s. 时由共同指数倾斜得到 `K''=1`，进而 Gaussian；这是完整
conditional closure theorem，但 full-SF 尚未推出该 constant-regression 条件。
full-SF 给出的只是正缺陷上界/下界，未产生反号。

R145 还构造了严格的 exchangeable joint probability witness：`(U,V)` 为标准
二维 Gaussian，`h(S)=exp(-S)-1/3`，`C_epsilon` 加入 bounded radial coupling，
使 residual vector 完全 Gaussian 但 `cum(C_epsilon,U,U)` 非零。它不是 iid
scalar candidate，故只能作为 `3D positivity + exchangeability` 的 obstruction，
不能作为研究问题 counterexample。

对 `g_N=P_(q^N)h_N`，ordinary mixed derivatives 按 `q^(Nm/2)` 衰减，而
Gaussian-renormalized shifted defect按 `(s,t)->(sqrt(lambda)s,sqrt(lambda)t)`
缩放；common/residual dependence 与 R141–R144 一样只是迁移到
`q^(-N/2)` 频率，没有被 OU 消灭。compatible single infinite tower 与
incompatible moving-top tower仍严格分开，spatial `P_3K_sp` bridge仍开放。

### Evidence grading after R145

`PROVED`：orthogonal coordinates、mixed-cumulant identity、finite Gram/Schur
upper bound、shifted Bessel–Schur inequality、division-free curvature inequality、
Appell regression identity、constant-regression Gaussian closure。

`CONDITIONAL`：`RK=1` 到 genuine full-SF/all-row、full-SF 到 constant regression、
ordinary/Bargmann 到 spatial `P_3K_sp`，以及任何 reverse defect。

`OBSTRUCTION`：iid 3D Bochner 是 Hadamard tautology；Hessian、entropy、R143
purity 与 R144 convolution 都给正缺陷方向；exchangeable witness不在 iid标量锥内。

`OPEN`：genuine iid fixed-sample-size `chi^2` characterization、incompatible
backward tower uniform closure、ordinary-to-spatial bridge。

唯一下一轮任务：**R146 — Tilted Sample-Variance Laplace / Constant-Regression
Rigidity**，研究
`Lambda(a,z)=E[exp(aC-zR^2)]/E exp(aC)` 的 boundary `Lambda(0,z)=(1+2z)^(-1)`
是否能通过 iid product/heat-kernel/total-positivity/log-convexity推出
`-partial_z Lambda(a,0)=2`；否则构造 legal exponential-family no-go。

## R146 — Tilted Sample-Variance Laplace / Laguerre–Heat（2026-09-08）

网页端读取了 R145 的公开记录后完成了本轮推导和全历史发表性审计。严格判断
仍为：

`无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）`。

这轮不是空转，而是形成了一个边界清晰的 lemma package：

1. 令 `C=(X_1+X_2+X_3)/sqrt(3)`、`Q=R^2`，
   `Lambda(a,z)=E exp(aC-zQ)/E exp(aC)`。共同指数倾斜给出
   `Lambda(sqrt(3)t,z)=E_(mu_t tensor 3) exp(-zQ)`；iid 分解进一步给出
   `F(t,z)=P_(2z/3)[L(.,z)^3](t)`。
2. full-SF/all-row 的精确边界是 `Lambda(0,z)=1/(1+2z)`，且 `Lambda` 对 `z`
   完全单调；`-partial_z Lambda(a,0)=2K''(a/sqrt(3))`。在密度正规性下，
   `z->infinity` 给出 `2pi sqrt(3) integral p_t^3` 的 cubic escort endpoint。
3. 置 `T=Q/2~Exp(1)`，Laguerre generating function 给出
   `(1+2z)Lambda=1+sum_(m>=1)ell_m(a)r^m`、`r=2z/(1+2z)`，且
   `ell_1(a)=1-K''(a/sqrt(3))`。进一步
   `sum ell_m(a)^2=chi^2(P_a^Q||chi^2_2)`，并受共同 tilt 的 `L^2` 界控制。
4. 精确的正源 PDE 为
   `(partial_z+(2/3)partial_t^2)log F=6 Var_(nu)(partial_y log L)>=0`。
   它在原点只推出 `Var_(0,z)(C)>=1/(1+2z)`，不能把单点 boundary 推成全 tilt
   equality；Gaussian 自身在 `z>0` 有正源 slack。
5. 条件闭合：若小 `a` 上 `ell_1(a)ell_1(-a)>=0`，或一侧有
   `K''<=1`/`K''>=1`，则 Gaussian；但现有 positivity/TP 工具没有给出这些符号。
   exchangeable witness 给出 relaxed no-go，但不在 iid 标量锥内。
6. 精确 OU 变换满足 `r'=lambda r`、
   `ell_m^(P_lambda mu)(a)=lambda^m ell_m^mu(sqrt(lambda)a)`。对 moving-top tower，
   `Xi_(g_N)(q^(-N/2)a)=sum_m q^(2mN)ell_m^(h_N)(a)^2`；若其为
   `o(q^(2N))` 才能推出首模消失，已有 unweighted bottom bound 不足以替代它。

本轮的整体判断是：项目已经从单纯低阶展开推进到一条可复用的
`zero-divisor/OU -> coherent defect -> iid bispectrum -> regression -> tilted
Laguerre` 技术链，但尚未产生能独立投稿的完整定理。不可省略的主缺口仍是

`Q~chi^2_2 + iid scalar factorization =>? ell_1(a)=0`。

本轮记录在 `r146_tilted_laguerre_heat_audit/README.md`，有限核验在
`r146_tilted_laguerre_heat_audit/audit_r146.py`。脚本只核验有限代数、有限
Laguerre 截断、OU Möbius 变换、Gaussian endpoint 和 witness 常数；不声称证明
全局 law、无限展开、tower uniformity 或发表新颖性。

## R147 — Dual Laguerre Regression / Positive-Backward Finite-Boundary Blindness（2026-09-08）

网页端本轮先读取公开 R146 记录，再对 R132–R146 进行整体审计。严格发表性结论为：

`无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）`。

本轮新增的可核验理论内容：

1. **对偶 Laguerre 回归定理。** 在 `Q~chi^2_2`、邻域 MGF 和矩确定性下，置
   `T=Q/2`、`ell_m'(0)=E[C L_m(T)]`，则
   `E[E[C|Q]^2]=sum_(m>=1)ell_m'(0)^2`。若首个非高斯累积量为 `d=2s+1`，
   `ell_s'(0)=(-1)^s sqrt(3)/(3^s s!) kappa_d`，从而
   `E[E[C|Q]^2]>=3^(2-d)kappa_d^2/(s!)^2`。因此
   `E[C|Q]=0 + Q~chi^2_2` 闭合为 Gaussian。该定理把原先 `E[Q|C]=2` 的 closure
   对偶化，并把主缺口压缩成 `Q~chi^2_2 =>? E[C|Q]=0`。
2. **反射 Laguerre 交叉谱。** `J(a)=sum_m ell_m(a)ell_m(-a)` 满足条件 Cauchy 下界，
   但该下界可为负；若 `G=E[C|Q]`，则 `J(a)=-a^2 E[G^2]+O(a^4)`。所以非高斯
   full-SF law 必有小 `a` 负 dip，而反射正性若能证明将直接成为 rigidity certificate。
3. **真正 iid 的正 backward 有限边界失明定理。** 对任意固定 `q`、有限正边界样本和
   任意近高斯阈值，存在严格正的 `g=P_qh`，匹配所有这些有限 Laplace 边界值，却有
   非零三阶累积量、负反射乘积和非零空间三次荷。证明使用高斯一阶变分、有限偶约束的
   IFT 校正和奇偶性。它不是 full-SF 反例，而是严格证明 continuum/all-row 不能由有限
   Taylor/Fock/Laguerre/边界审计替代。
4. **OU/tower 反射滤波器。** `ell_m^(P_lambda h)(A)=lambda^m ell_m^h(sqrt(lambda)A)`，
   在 `A=a/sqrt(lambda)` 下，`lambda^-2 J` 等于顶层一阶反射乘积加余项，余项受
   `lambda^2 sqrt(Xi(a)Xi(-a))` 控制。moving-top 候选接口是
   `J_(g_N)(q^(-N/2)a)>=-o(q^(2N))`，目前仍未由 positivity 推出。

全局定位仍是
`chi-square sample variance -> zero-divisor/OU -> coherent defect -> iid bispectrum`
`-> regression -> tilted Laguerre`；R132、R138、R140–R147 已有明确假设下的 theorem/
lemma packages，但 scalar `RK=1` 到 full-SF、full-SF 到 dual regression、moving-top
tower uniform closure 和 ordinary-to-spatial `P_3K_sp` bridge 仍 OPEN/CONDITIONAL。

下一轮部署为 **R148 — Continuum Circular Boundary => Zero Common-Mode Regression**，只
攻击全连续参数的
`Q~chi^2_2 + iid scalar factorization =>? E[C|Q]=0`，等价研究
`E[C J_0(t sqrt(Q))]=0` 全 `t>=0` 或 `partial_s A(0,t)=0`。若失败，要求连续变换层面
的 honest no-go，不再重复有限信息构造。

本轮本机记录：`r147_dual_regression_finite_boundary_audit/README.md`，有限接口核验：
`r147_dual_regression_finite_boundary_audit/audit_r147.py`。脚本只核验有限代数与缩放，
不声称证明全局 law、无限级数、函数空间 IFT、tower uniformity 或发表新颖性。

## R148 — Continuum Circular Boundary / Dual Regression / Reflection Deficit（2026-09-08）

网页端完成了 R148，并读取了公开 R147 提交 `153ffabdadd885625d8fedb6999b9b9e1b945da8`。
严格发表性结论仍为：

`无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）`。

本轮新增内容与本机审计记录：

1. **Bessel–Laguerre dual completeness。** 令 `T=Q/2~Exp(1)`、
   `a_m=E[C L_m(T)]`。精确积分
   `int exp(-x)L_m(x)J_0(2 sqrt(xy))dx=exp(-y)y^m/m!`
   给出
   `E[C|Q]=0 <=> a_m=0 (all m) <=> E[CJ_0(t sqrt(Q))]=0 (all t)`，
   并与 `E[Ce^(-zQ)]=0 (all z>0)` 等价。这是连续层面的 exact transform theorem。
2. **Circular transform 缺口。**
   `A(s,t)=(1/(2pi))int product_j phi(s/sqrt(3)+tr_j(theta))dtheta`
   精确等于 `E[e^(isC)J_0(t sqrt(Q))]`；full-SF 只给
   `A(0,t)=e^(-t^2/2)`，目标是 `partial_sA(0,t)=0`。Fourier 展开只定位 boundary trace
   与 common normal derivative，未产生新的闭合。
3. **Gaussian continuum linearization。**
   `D F_1[f]=3<f,A_z>`，`A_z` 为显示的 Gaussian profile；Hermite 偶模 multiplier
   `3/(1+2z)*sqrt((2m)!)/m!*(-r/3)^m`，奇模全为零，且 even inverse 指数病态。
   这严格说明 finite IFT 不能以 uniform right inverse 升级到 continuum，也排除自然范数下
   的一阶 Lipschitz coercivity；不构成 exact positive full-SF 反例。
4. **Reflection-Symmetrization Laplace Deficit。**
   `mu=nu+sigma` 的奇偶展开给
   `F_z(mu)=F_z(nu)+3Q_z^nu(sigma)`，其中平方和展开证明 `Q_z^nu(sigma)>=0`，
   `sigma!=0` 时在相应可积性下严格正。因此 exact full-SF 的 asymmetric candidate 必须让
   对称化 law 严格低于 Gaussian boundary。反向不等式没有由 positivity/backward 自动得到。
5. **OU/tower normalized shape。** 对 `D_mu(t)=E[CJ_0(t sqrt(Q))]`、
   `hat(D)=e^(t^2/2)D`，有
   `hat(D)_(P_lambda mu)(t)=sqrt(lambda)hat(D)_mu(sqrt(lambda)t)`；moving-top 的
   `q^(-N/2)hat(D)_(g_N)(q^(-N/2)t)=hat(D)_(h_N)(t)`，但底部普通 `L^2` 仍不足以控制该尺度。

R148 之后的总体链为

`chi-square variance -> zero-divisor/OU -> coherent defect -> iid bispectrum`
`-> common regression -> tilted Laguerre -> continuum dual transform -> reflection deficit`。

当前仍不可省略的 OPEN bridges 是：`RK=1=>full-SF/all-row`、
`Q~chi^2_2+iid=>E[C|Q]=0`、incompatible tower uniform closure，以及 ordinary-to-spatial
`P_3K_sp`。所以记录中的发表性回答保持“无”；准确描述是已有可独立整理的连续理论包，
但尚未形成闭合、经过新颖性核验的独立论文定理。

本轮本机有限审计：`r148_continuum_circular_reflection_audit/audit_r148.py`。它仅核验
Bessel–Laguerre 积分、有限 generating interface、Hermite multipliers、反射分解和 OU
归一化接口，不声称证明无限维或 global law 结论。下一轮部署为 **R149 — Nonlinear
Reflection-Compensation / Odd-to-Even Continuum Coercivity**，只研究
`F_z(nu)+3Q_z^nu(sigma)=1/(1+2z)` 的 all-order positive-cone 可行性。

## R149 — Nonlinear Reflection Compensation / Odd-to-Even Continuum Coercivity（2026-09-08）

网页端完成 R149 后，本机新增 `r149_nonlinear_reflection_compensation_audit/`。本轮严格
记录边界为：

`无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）`。

本轮新增的可独立复核内容如下：

1. **有限 signed measure 的严格反射二次型。** `0<exp(-zQ)<=1` 使 `Q_z^nu(sigma)` 对有限
   总变差自动绝对收敛。Gaussian feature identity 给出非负平方和；若 equality，Gaussian-
   damped transform 是 entire，Fourier uniqueness 强制 `sigma=0`。所以 `sigma!=0` 时
   `Q_z^nu(sigma)>0` 对每个 `z>0`，不需要原始 bilateral exponential moment。反射包络
   `|sigma|<=nu` 进一步给出 `0<=Q_z^nu(sigma)<F_z(nu)`，因此 exact full-SF 的非对称候选
   只能位于 `G(z)/4<F_z(nu)<G(z)`。
2. **Odd Hermite 的完整二阶 source。** 对 `sigma_d=psi_d gamma`、odd `d>=3`，
   `r=2z/(1+2z)`，source 为 `G(z)(T_d/3^d)r^d`；本机 Gauss–Hermite quadrature 和中心
   trinomial recurrence 均通过。R148 continuum inverse 给唯一偶修正
   `A_d psi_(2d)`，`A_d=d!T_d/sqrt((2d)!)`，其渐近为
   `(sqrt(3)/2)(3/2)^d(pi d)^(-1/4)`。
3. **正性结论的准确边界。** 二阶远尾 profile 的判别式在 `d>=5` 失败，例如
   `4T_5/binom(10,5)=17/21`；但这只是 finite-order truncation no-go，因为相同远尾尺度
   上三阶及更高阶项也为 `O(1)`。真实 all-order OU 重求和回到自动正的 `B_mu`，所以不能
   把二阶负尾当作 genuine full-SF 反例。R137 fixed-degree Hankel cap 也不足以给 moving-
   degree uniform contradiction。
4. **OU 接口与未解问题。** 反射 source 与 OU 的 Möbius 变量满足 `r'=lambda r`；底部
   physical Laplace 域不能直接放大 top radial shape，而 high common-tilt / high-spatial
   尺度保留 all-order information。真正剩下的是 moving-degree 的正定/Hankel coherence，
   不是再做有限采样或低阶展开。

网页端下一轮总审计/研究任务为 **R150**：先按公开仓库重构 R132–R149 的 PROVED、
CONDITIONAL、FORMAL/FINITE-ONLY、OBSTRUCTION、OPEN 全脉络并再次判断发表性；随后只推进
一个精确定理，即 moving-degree 的 tail-stable Hankel/Bochner margin，或证明高阶对角重求和
能够系统逃逸该 margin。网页端工作前必须阅读本仓库的 Framework、Worklog 与 R148/R149
审计目录；本轮不把网页推导、有限核验或未检索到文献写成独立新颖定理。

## R150 — Robust Sparse-Branch Hankel Collapse / Moving-Degree Resummation（2026-09-08）

网页端先完成 R132–R149 全局脉络与发表性总审计，再继续本轮唯一数学目标。公开审计时
`main` 与 `theory/r129-active` 一致指向 R148；R149 已随后本机记录并推送为
`7f7c037b55ce178d631a1eb88b97fe66c5c8dfb2`。R150 的严格发表性结论仍为：

`无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）`。

本轮新增的小里程碑是一个 robust fixed-degree reduction。固定 `d=2s+1>=5`，若首个 odd
coefficient `c_d=a`，则 finite full-SF triangular equations 在有限阶把 Hankel 矩阵写成
`H_M(a,b)` 的有限多项式映射。R137 的 sparse feasibility radius `rho_M(d)->0` 给定
`0<epsilon<R_d` 后产生有限 cutoff `M_*(d,epsilon)`；紧集
`K={epsilon<=|a|<=R_d}` 上 sparse slice 的最小特征值有负裕量 `delta_*>0`。矩阵映射
的统一连续性与 Weyl 不等式于是给出 `eta_*(d,epsilon)>0`：若有限 window 内所有
higher odd coefficients不超过该模量，则某个 Hankel minor/最小特征值严格为负。

因此 genuine full-SF law 若要保留首个 odd packet，必须在一个由 `d,epsilon` 决定的有限
degree window 中补入不可忽略的 higher odd coefficient。这不是 finite sparse theorem 的
重复，而是对 higher-odd tail 的稳定必要条件；但它没有排除无限 tail。

进一步，对固定 genuine law `h` 和 `g_lambda=P_lambda h`，Bargmann 缩放给出
`c_n(g_lambda)=lambda^(n/2)c_n(h)`。若 `log B_h` 在固定 disk 内无零点，Cauchy 估计与
robust modulus 合并为

`eta_d(a)<=K_(h,R)a^(1+2/d)`。

所以若能证明某固定 `d` 上 `eta_d(a)/a^(1+2/d)` 在 `a down 0` 无界，就能排除该 degree
的 genuine non-Gaussian full-SF law。这把一个无限维问题压缩成可量化的有限 Hankel
stability rate。但当 `d->infinity` 时临界指数趋于 1，且 `log B` 的 zero-free radius
可能退化；moving-degree 仍 OPEN。

本机新增目录 `r150_robust_hankel_resummation_audit/`，脚本通过：

`R150_INHERITED_SPARSE_HANKEL_CAP_PASSED`

`R150_FINITE_POLYNOMIAL_CONTINUITY_MODEL_PASSED`

`R150_OU_DIAGONAL_RATE_ALGEBRA_PASSED`

`R150_R149_SOURCE_INTERFACE_PASSED`

`R150_SCOPE_EXPLICIT: fixed-degree reduction only; joint moving-degree rate remains open`

`R150_AUDIT_COMPLETED`

本轮不构造 genuine non-Gaussian full-SF law，也不声称主问题解决或已有新颖可投稿成果。
下一轮唯一目标是量化 `eta_d(a)` 在 `d->infinity,a->0` 联合极限的下界；若无法得到统一
margin，则必须构造经过 Hankel/Bochner、square-exponential 和 zero-free 尺度审计的 diagonal
escape，不能以 finite/formal jet 代替。

## R151 — Critical Hermite-Gram Shape / Canonical Rescue Modulus（2026-09-08）

网页端本轮按公开仓库完成了 R132–R150 的全脉络与发表性审计，并明确回答：

`无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）`。

这不是“没有进展”，而是已有内容仍是相互衔接的 lemma packages：精确的 zero-divisor/OU
缩放、posterior/escort 缺陷、iid bispectrum 与 common-mode regression、Laguerre/Bessel
连续变换、反射二次型、以及 fixed-degree Hankel tail-stability。它们尚未共同闭合
`RK=1 => full-SF`、全阶正定锥、moving-top backward tower 和 spatial `P_3 K` 桥，因此
不能包装成独立新颖论文结果。

本轮修正 R150 的一个逻辑问题：原 `eta_*` 是任意充分小的 continuity radius，不能谈其
本身的渐近。定义 Hermite Gram `Gamma_M(a,b)` 后，置

`M_d^sharp(a)=min{M:Gamma_M(a,0) not PSD}`，
`delta_d^sharp(a)=-lambda_min Gamma_(M_d^sharp(a))(a,0)`，

以及规范的
`eta_d^sharp(a)=inf{||b||_infty:Gamma_(M_d^sharp(a))(a,b)>=0}`（空集时为 infinity）。
若 `L_(d,M)(a,r)=sup_(||b||<=r)sum_j||partial_(b_j)Gamma_M(a,b)||_op`，则

`eta_d^sharp(a)>=sup{r:rL_(d,M_d^sharp(a))(a,r)<delta_d^sharp(a)}`。

这是可计算的 finite-dimensional lower bound，但 R137 没有给出 `M_d^sharp` 或
`delta_d^sharp` 的速率，所以仍没有 honest power-law rigidity。

网页端新推导的核心精确恒等式是：若 `C(z)=log B_mu(z)=sum c_k z^k`，则

`sum Gamma_mn u^m/sqrt(m!)v^n/sqrt(n!)=exp(uv+C(u+v))`。

在 Gaussian 点，`r=(m+n-k)/2` 时

`partial_(c_k)Gamma_mn|_0=sqrt(m!n!)*binom(k,m-r)/r!`，

否则为零。对 `m=M,n=M+1`、`d=2s+1`，

`L_(d,M)=binom(d,s)sqrt(M+1)(M)_(under s)`，

且

`L_(d+2,M)/L_(d,M)=4(d+2)/(d+3)(M-s)`，

`L_(d+2j,M)/L_(d,M)`
`=[binom(d+2j,s+j)/binom(d,s)](M-s)_(under j)`。

故临界 `M~tau|a|^(-2/d)` 下，若
`c_(d+2j)=u_j|a|^(1+2j/d)`，各固定 higher-odd band 都是 `O(1)`；单个 block
不能给出超临界 coercivity。OU 变换 `c_n(P_lambda mu)=lambda^(n/2)c_n(mu)` 进一步说明

`u_j=c_(d+2j)/|c_d|^(1+2j/d)`

是严格不变的 critical shape 坐标。这把下一步准确压缩成 all-order critical shape cone。

证据分层：`PROVED` 为上述定义、生成恒等式、敏感度、临界幂次和 OU 不变性；
`CONDITIONAL` 为依赖 scaled negative gap/eta 下界的 rigidity；`FORMAL/FINITE-ONLY`
为 single-block cancellation 与有限支持 critical vector；`OPEN` 为半经典 Gram limit、
shape cone、`d->infinity` uniformity、genuine positive lift、backward tower 和 spatial
bridge。本机目录为 `r151_critical_shape_hankel_audit/`，脚本只核验有限精确系数，不认证
全阶正定、主问题、counterexample、novelty 或发表准备度。

网页端下一轮唯一任务部署为 **R152 — Semiclassical Sparse Hankel Limit / Critical
Shape Cone**：在 `c_d=A lambda^(d/2)`、`c_(d+2j)=U_j lambda^((d+2j)/2)`、
`M=floor(tau/lambda)` 下推进 normalized Hermite/Hankel quadratic-form limit；先做
finite-support `U`，再讨论 closure，并分别报告 operator-level result 与 genuine
positive iid liftability，禁止把前者冒充后者。

## R152 — Semiclassical Hermite-Gram Bulk Limit / Toeplitz Positivity（2026-09-08）

本机独立继续推进网页端部署的 R152，先得到一个必须纳入总审计的方向修正。全局发表性
判断仍为：

`无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）`。

对有限 support 的实 critical shape
`C_lambda(z)=sum_(k in K)U_k lambda^(k/2)z^k`，令
`E(z)=exp(sum_kU_kz^k)`。由于 `exp(C_lambda(z))=E(sqrt(lambda)z)`，Hermite-Gram
生成核直接给出条目公式：

`Gamma_mn=sum_K e_Klambda^(K/2)sqrt(m!n!)/((m+n-K)/2)!
             binom(K,(K+m-n)/2)`，

其中 `e_K=[z^K]E`，只对 parity/range admissible 的 `K` 求和。令
`M=floor(tau/lambda)` 且 `p,q` 固定，则固定偏移条目趋于

`Gamma_(M+p,M+q)->G_(p-q)(tau,U)`，

`G_l=sum_K e_Ktau^(K/2)binom(K,(K+l)/2)`。

用 `sqrt(m!n!)/t!<=max(m,n)^(K/2)`、`binom(K,.)<=2^K` 和 `E` entire 可作级数支配，
但这只是 local quadratic-form convergence；support 随 `lambda^(-1)` 增长的向量仍不在
结论内。

`G_l` 是 Laurent symbol

`F_(tau,U)(x)=exp(sum_kU_ktau^(k/2)(x+x^(-1))^k)`

的系数。在 `x=e^(itheta)` 上，实 shape 给 `F>0`。所以极限 Toeplitz 矩阵满足

`sum_(p,q)conjugate(z_p)G_(p-q)z_q`
`=(1/(2pi))int F(e^(itheta))|sum_pz_pe^(iptheta)|^2dtheta>=0`。

这意味着：R152 原先希望在 `M~tau/lambda` 的 fixed-offset bulk 找 sparse negative
operator 的目标被严格否定；并非主命题否定。R137 的 eventual finite-rank sparse
collapse 仍在，因此真正失败若存在，必须是 growing-support、edge/boundary、无
finite-support shape limit，或 global zero-free/Hankel coherence。

证据层级：`PROVED at formal/operator coefficient level` 为 scaled extraction、
fixed-offset Toeplitz limit 与 symbol positivity；`NUMERICALLY AUDITED` 为有限高精度
条目收敛和 Toeplitz eigenvalue；`OPEN` 为 uniform growing-support/edge asymptotics、
positive iid liftability、`RK=1=>full-SF`、tower 与 spatial bridge。本机目录为
`r152_semiclassical_toeplitz_audit/`，脚本不认证 genuine law 或主问题。

网页端下一轮唯一目标改为 **R153 — Edge / Growing-Support Semiclassical Hankel
Escape**：先读取 R151/R152，复核 bulk Toeplitz obstruction，再研究 edge 或
growing-support 负方向；不得把 bulk 正性包装成全局 rigidity。

## R153 — Full-Section Gauss–Hermite Coercivity（2026-09-09）

网页端本轮从 R152 的 fixed-offset Toeplitz 正性继续推进，给出 full Hermite section
的 Gauss–Hermite quadrature 机制。本机随后独立核验，严格发表性结论仍为：

`无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）`。

### 82.1 这轮新增的可保留结论

对
`K_lambda(u,v)=exp(uv)E_lambda(sqrt(lambda)(u+v))`，写
`E_lambda(y)=sum e_(k,lambda)y^k`，定义

`g_(lambda,M)(x)=sum_(k=0)^(2M)e_(k,lambda)lambda^(k/2)He_k(x)`。

则对 `m,n<=M`，用 `psi_m=He_m/sqrt(m!)` 有精确有限恒等式

`Gamma_mn=int g_(lambda,M)psi_mpsi_n d gamma`。

取 `N=2M+1` 个标准 Gauss–Hermite 节点与正权，因
`deg(g_(lambda,M)p^2)<=4M<2N`，得到整个 section 的精确二次型公式

`z^*Gamma_Mz=sum_jw_jg_(lambda,M)(x_j)|p(x_j)|^2`，
`sum_jw_j|p(x_j)|^2=||z||_2^2`。

节点估计 `|x_j|<2sqrt(N)` 将 `M=floor(tau/lambda)` 时的全部节点压入
`|sqrt(lambda)x_j|<=R_tau=2sqrt(2tau+1)`。因此如果存在统一的复圆界
`sup_lambda sup_|z|=S|E_lambda(z)|<=B`（`S>D_tau`）和统一实紧区间正 gap
`inf_lambda inf_|y|<=R_tau E_lambda(y)>=m_tau>0`，网页端的 generalized-Hermite
误差估计可以推出

`Gamma_floor(tau/lambda)^(lambda)>=m_tau/2 I`

对充分小 `lambda` 成立。这是本轮真正有价值的条件性推进：在该 analytic/real-gap
类中，edge 与 growing-support 不能产生负方向。

### 82.2 本机独立审计

目录 `r153_full_section_coercivity_audit/` 的脚本实际通过：

`R153_EXACT_DENSITY_NORMALISATION_PASSED`

`R153_GAUSS_HERMITE_DEGREE_COUNT_PASSED`

`R153_GAUSS_NODE_ENVELOPE_PASSED`

`R153_GENERALIZED_HERMITE_BOUND_PASSED`

`R153_COMPACT_TRUNCATION_BOUND_PASSED`

`R153_CONDITIONAL_NODE_POSITIVITY_MODEL_PASSED`

`R153_R132_COMPACT_GAP_EXPONENT_PASSED`

`R153_SCOPE_EXPLICIT: finite/algebraic audit only; uniform branch hypotheses and original rigidity remain open`

`R153_AUDIT_COMPLETED`。

因此可以把 R153 记为 `LOCAL-AUDITED` 的 finite full-section coercivity package，
而不是原始 backward-tower 定理。特别要保留以下边界：R132 型 complex bound/real gap
接口在代数上相容，但 `RK=1=>full-SF`、sparse completion 的 uniform entire shape、
positive iid liftability、moving-degree escape 和 spatial `P_3K` 仍未解决。

### 82.3 下一轮部署

R154 只研究 supercritical 标度
`tau_lambda=lambda M_lambda -> infinity`，比较负的 generalized-Hermite tail depth
与 degree-`M` polynomial 的 Christoffel localisation cost。必须二选一：

1. 给出显式增长包络与 coercivity 下界；或
2. 给出一个确实具有足够负尾部 Christoffel 质量的 polynomial 负方向。

单点负值、有限 formal truncation 或未经验证的 shape closure 都不算 Gram 负方向。
若没有独立、完整、可审稿的新结果，下一轮仍明确回答“无”。

## R154 — Supercritical Escape-Energy / Christoffel Localisation（2026-09-09，本机部署前推进）

在等待网页端进入 R154 前，本机先完成了一个精确的 finite-dimensional reduction。
若 R153 密度表示为
`z^*Gamma_Mz=int g_(lambda,M)|p_z|^2d gamma`，对区间 `I` 定义

`A_M(I)=[int_Ipsi_mpsi_n d gamma]_(m,n=0)^M`，
`Theta_M(I)=lambda_max A_M(I)`，

并且 `g<=-a` on `I`、`g<=b` on `I^c`，则严格有

`Gamma_M<=bI-(a+b)A_M(I)`，
`lambda_min(Gamma_M)<=b-(a+b)Theta_M(I)`。

因此只要
`Theta_M(I)>b/(a+b)`，就得到真正的 Gram negative direction；等价地，
Christoffel leakage `1-Theta_M(I)` 必须小于 `a/(a+b)`。这就是“负尾深度”与
“degree-M 多项式局部化代价”的准确连接。单点负值不够。

进一步取 Hermite reproducing kernel
`K_M(x,y)=sum_(n=0)^Mpsi_n(x)psi_n(y)`，令
`p(x)=K_M(x,x_0)/sqrt(K_M(x_0,x_0))`。由
`||p'||_2^2<=M` 和 reproducing bound，若
`I=[x_0-h,x_0+h]` 满足
`h sqrt(M sup_IK_(M-1)(x,x))<=sqrt(K_M(x_0,x_0))/2`，则

`Theta_M(I)>=K_M(x_0,x_0)gamma(I)/4`。

这给出了一个虽未必 edge-sharp、但完全可计算的 Christoffel 局部化下界。

本机目录 `r154_escape_energy_audit/` 已实际通过：

`R154_CONCENTRATION_MATRIX_PASSED`

`R154_CHRISTOFFEL_NEGATIVE_DIRECTION_PASSED`

`R154_POINTWISE_NEGATIVITY_NOT_SUFFICIENT_PASSED`

`R154_REPRODUCING_KERNEL_LOCALISATION_BOUND_PASSED`

`R154_SCALED_INTERVAL_BOOKKEEPING_PASSED`

`R154_SCOPE_EXPLICIT: exact finite criterion only; supercritical tail and genuine branch remain open`

`R154_AUDIT_COMPLETED`。

严格边界：这是 `PROVED/LOCAL-AUDITED` 的 exact finite criterion，不是 R137 completed
sparse branch 的 negative interval，也不是 genuine iid counterexample。下一轮网页端应
把 `tau_lambda=lambda M_lambda->infty` 下的 scaled interval、`a_lambda`、`b_lambda`
与 `Theta_M(I)` 同时量化；如只能得到条件性结果，必须明确假设；发表性判断仍为“无”。

## R155 — 全历史脉络与发表性审计部署（2026-09-09）

R154 的网页消息已确认回显，但网页端随后仅显示“已停止思考”，没有正文。本机将
该事件记录为执行状态，不把它解释为数学上的“无结果”。新目录
`r155_global_publication_audit/` 保存了这一边界和下一轮部署要求。

下一轮网页端必须先阅读公开 `THEORY_ROUTE_FRAMEWORK.md`、本工作日志以及 R153/R154
审计，然后用整体视角复盘：主问题与量词、compatible tower、R132–R154 的逻辑链、
已证/本机审计/条件性/形式性/有限维/阻碍/开放项，以及哪些内容具有独立技术价值但
仍不足以称为完整可投稿结果。若严格审计后仍无此类结果，必须原样保留：
“无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）”。

整体复盘之后继续 R154 的唯一主线：
`tau_lambda=lambda M_lambda -> infinity`，同时处理 scaled negative-tail depth、
`a_lambda`、补集 `b_lambda` 与 Hermite/Christoffel leakage；只能二选一：得到
supercritical coercivity/no-go，或构造真正满足 concentration threshold 的负方向。
网页中止、pointwise negativity、piecewise signed model 和 finite jet 均不改变证据等级。

### R155 网页端中间进度（未完成、待核验）

R155 已在同一研究对话成功发送。网页端在全历史审计和 R154 推导过程中暂时报告：
把归一化区间指标函数投影到前 `M` 个 Hermite modes，试图由 Hermite 尾能量控制
`1-Theta_M(I)`；并提出内侧区间候选下界
`Theta_M(I)>=1-C_L x_0^2/M`，以及 turning-zone 外侧的指数小候选上界。

当前只能记为 `WEB-DRAFT / UNVERIFIED`。需待网页端完整回复后，本机重新核验函数空间
归属、归一化、尾能量不等式、指数率和 `a_lambda/b_lambda` 阈值合并；不能把这段中间
文本当作已证定理或发表性结果。

## 2026-09-09 — R155 最终全局审计与 R156 部署边界

网页端 R155 已给出完整历史表：R8--R11 的 posterior/escort/Fredholm 主线、R132--R138
的 square-exponential / sparse-Hankel / infinite-tail 边界、R140--R150 的 shell/
bispectrum/regression/Laguerre/reflection 技术包，以及 R151--R154 的 Hermite/
Toeplitz/coercivity/Christoffel 路线。它明确区分了“技术上有价值”和“已有独立可投稿
结果”，最终结论仍是：

`无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）`

### R156 网页端完成回执与 R157 部署（2026-09-09）

网页端完成 R156 后给出三项可保留内容：fixed-`d` sparse formal recursion 的
weighted-homogeneous universal one-variable shape 候选；first-failure 的定义、
存在性、`M_d^sharp(a)->infinity` 与真实 Gauss-node 负值必要条件；以及 quadratic
prefix 模型的 bulk negative block/负特征值裕量。网页端明确 literal edge-escape B
没有证明。

本机 R156 审计已验证 quadratic prefix 的有限实例，但也验证 all-order formal
completion 在 `M=7,...,12` 可出现负节点而 Gram 仍正定。因此 quadratic 结论不能越级
成 completed branch 的 A；active negative mass 仍是缺失桥。网页端的结论已按
`FINITE-ONLY / FORMAL / OPEN` 记录，整体发表性结论仍为“无”。

网页端下一步部署为 **R157 — Universal Sparse-Shape Partial-Sum / Singularity
Theorem**：研究 universal shape `E_d(t)=sum beta_{d,n}t^n` 在 `n~M` 与
`t~sgn(a)(x/sqrt(M))^d tau^(d/2)` 下的联合行为，二择一证明全阶 bulk negativity
或全阶 bulk positivity；只有后者成立后才进入 turning/Airy 分析。R157 目前是
`OPEN / WEB-REVIEW`。

当前最值得保留为论文候选模块的是 R147--R150 的 dual-regression/反射补偿链和
R151--R155 的 critical Hermite--Christoffel 链；但 `RK=1=>full-SF/all-row`、genuine
positive realization、moving-top sign profile 与 spatial `P_3K` bridge 都还没有闭合。

本机实际执行：

`F:\\anaconda3\\python.exe r155_global_publication_audit\\audit_r155.py`

通过 Hermite--Sobolev tail scale、coherent/Poisson rate、outer hypercontractive rate
`J(c)`、以及 `N=2M+1` Gauss--Hermite finite criterion 的公式和次数检查。证据等级只
提升为标准假设下的 `PROVED/LOCAL-AUDITED` 公式接口；将接口应用到 R137 completed
sparse branch 仍是 `CONDITIONAL/OPEN`。

纠正网页端一个容易过强的表述：`Theta_M(I)>b/(a+b)` 是两层包络下的充分证书，且在
piecewise envelope 模型中 sharp；它不是任意 `g` 的负 Gram 方向普遍必要条件。故
outer-tail 指数结果只阻断依赖该证书的 moderate-depth outer-well 路线，不能声称
无条件排除所有负方向。

下一步 R156 只研究 **Completed-Sparse Gauss-Node Turning-Profile Theorem**：在 first
failure 的 Gauss--Hermite 节点上判定 bulk negative node，或证明所有失败序列逃到
turning scale 并且深度比消失。该命题是 R137 radius collapse 与 R154 localization
criterion 之间的唯一剩余桥接。

## 2026-09-09 — R156 Completed-Sparse Gauss-Node Turning-Profile 部署

R156 已向同一网页研究对话发送，公开基线为 `9c12b63`；本机新增
`r156_turning_profile_audit/README.md`，仅记录定义与边界，不宣称 A/B 分支已证。

目标是 fixed odd `d` 的 formal full-SF sparse completion，在 first-failing section
`M_d^sharp(a)` 的 `2M+1` 阶 Gauss--Hermite nodes 上研究
`G_{j,M}=g_{d,a,M}(x_{j,M})`。已有有限推论是：quadrature 对 degree-`2M` Gram
integrand 精确；所有节点值非负则 `Gamma_M` PSD，非 PSD 必出现真实节点负值。该推论
仍是 `FINITE-ONLY/FORMAL`，不能当作 genuine iid realization。

网页端被要求严格二择一：A，证明 bulk negative node 与统一相对深度并导出负特征值；或
B，证明负节点逃至 Hermite edge `|x|/sqrt(M)->2` 且深度比逃过 bulk localization
阈值，再进入 Airy scale。若暂不能证明，必须退回可核验 partial lemma 并标为
`CONDITIONAL/OPEN`。R155 的发表性判断继续为“无”。

### R156 本机有限计算结果（2026-09-09）

本机修正并运行 `r156_turning_profile_audit/audit_r156.py`。参数为 `d=5`、
`a=1/50`，full-SF even recursion 只求到 cumulant degree `24`，然后审计
`M=1,...,12` 的 formal moments、Hermite Gram 与 `2M+1` 个 Gauss--Hermite nodes。
脚本通过：

`R156_SPARSE_FORMAL_COMPLETION_FINITE_GRADE_PASSED`

`R156_GAUSS_HERMITE_EXACT_REPLAY_PASSED`

`R156_NEGATIVE_NODE_WITH_GRAM_PSD_PASSED`

`R156_QUADRATIC_MODEL_BULK_AUDIT_PASSED`

`R156_AUDIT_COMPLETED`

具体现象是 `M=7` 起节点最小值已经为负，但 Gram 最小特征值仍为正；`M=12` 时
二者分别为 `-1.442312` 与 `0.134921`，且
`R156_FIRST_FAILURE_M=NONE_WITHIN_AUDITED_GRADE`。所以当前可核验的有限结论是：

`negative Gauss node != first Hankel/Gram failure`。

脚本还单独复核了网页端的 quadratic prefix：`d=5`、`a=10^{-2}`、临界 `M=9` 时，
最小节点值为 `-11.079375`、负节点数为 `3`，并有
`lambda_min(Gamma_M)=-5.384434`。这只核验 finite quadratic model 的 bulk failure，
不核验 all-order completed branch 的 A。

这不是对 R137 的反例，也不是 genuine iid 结论；它只是排除了一个过强的局部推断，
并明确指出 A/B 需要研究负节点的群体质量、相对深度和 Christoffel 局部化，而不是
只看单点符号。正式证据等级为 `LOCAL-AUDITED / FORMAL / FINITE-ONLY / OPEN`，
整体发表性判断不变：

`无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）`

### R157 已发送、网页端处理中（2026-09-09）

本机将 R156 的有限边界与 `d7e0952` 公开基线发送回同一网页研究对话，部署
**R157 — Universal Sparse-Shape Partial-Sum / Singularity Theorem**。网页端已开始
读取公开记录，并报告正在从 `Phi_d(t)=t+even powers` 得到
`E_d(t)=e^tA_d(t^2)` 与一变量收缩方程，随后研究收敛半径/奇点及 `n~M` 的全阶
部分和。当前为 `WEB-IN-PROGRESS`；发送后的网页轮次仍在运行，不能把中间文本写成
数学结论，也不重复发送。

### R157 本机精确有限核验（2026-09-09）

网页端仍未返回完整正文。本机先将网页端已经明确的结构写成独立审计：在 D3 exact
Laurent-polynomial 模型中，固定 odd `d`、`E_d(t)=exp(t)A_d(t^2)`，验证

`<cosh(sqrt(s)p_d) product_j A_d(sR_j)>=1`，其中 `R_j=r_j^(2d)`。

对所写的一变量方程，新增系数的直接线性系数是

`mu_{d,n}=3*binom(2dn,dn)/6^(dn)`；其互补收缩缺陷才是

`Delta_{d,n}=1-mu_{d,n}`。

两者必须区分：有限递推的非奇异性在当前方程中使用 `mu_{d,n}>0`，不能把
`Delta_{d,n}` 直接称为同一个 pivot。

本机运行 `r157_universal_shape_audit/audit_r157.py`，通过：

`R157_D3_CONTRACTION_PIVOTS_PASSED`

`R157_ONE_VARIABLE_RECURSION_PASSED`

`R157_EVEN_LOG_SHAPE_PASSED`

`R157_FINITE_FORMAL_RESIDUAL_PASSED`

`R157_AUDIT_COMPLETED`

审计范围为 `d=5,7,9,11`、`n=1,...,8` 的 `mu_{d,n}` 与 `Delta_{d,n}` 的正性，以及 `d=5` 到 `s^3` 的
exact formal recursion/residual。具体得到

`A_5(s)=1-(25/84)s+(14995625/186234048)s^2`

`-(733418534375/31302963724032)s^3+O(s^4)`。

这是一条可复核的结构性 partial lemma，证据等级为
`PROVED UNDER STATED FINITE FORMAL MODEL / LOCAL-AUDITED`。它仍不触及 R157 的
核心 all-order convergence/singularity、`n~M` partial-sum sign，以及 formal branch
到 genuine positive law 的桥。因此不能把它写成完整发表性定理；整体结论仍为：

`无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）`

### R157 形式递推的全阶提升（条件性记录）

进一步逐项检查可得到：若把网页端的一变量 reduction 作为形式前提，令
`A_d(s)=1+sum_(n>=1)a_n s^n`，则 `s^n` 系数中新的 `a_n` 只能出现在三个
`A_d(sR_j)` 因子中的一个，故

`[s^n](F_d(A_d;s)-1)=mu_(d,n)a_n+P_(d,n)(a_1,...,a_(n-1))`，

其中 `P_(d,n)` 只依赖低阶系数，且

`mu_(d,n)=3*binom(2dn,dn)/6^(dn)>0`。

所以形式方程在每个 `n` 唯一确定 `a_n=-P_(d,n)/mu_(d,n)`，这是
`PROVED UNDER THE STATED FORMAL REDUCTION` 的 all-order formal triangular
existence/uniqueness lemma。由 `|r_j|<=sqrt(2/3)`，对 fixed odd `d>=5` 有
`mu_(d,n)<=3(2/3)^(dn)<1`，但 `Delta_(d,n)=1-mu_(d,n)` 只是互补收缩缺陷，
不能误称为当前方程的直接系数。

该提升仍没有给出 analytic convergence、奇点、系数控制、`n~M` partial-sum
符号或 genuine positive realization；因此整体发表性结论不变。

### R157 网页回执后的 majorant 审计与全局分层（2026-09-09）

网页端已经完成 R157。它声称在 universal sparse formal shape 的一变量方程上，
利用 odd-`d` 几何不等式、generalized Holder 和 Hermite 绝对值估计，得到正
majorant

`D(s)B(s)^3-6B(s)+5=0`, `D(s)=3cosh(sqrt(s))-2`,

并据此给出 `T*=arcosh(82/75)`、completed formal branch 的低能区正性，以及
`liminf |a|^(2/d) M_d^sharp(a) >= e^(-1/4)T*^(2/d)/8`。

由于这些是网页端新推导，不能直接视为已经完成的本机证明。本机新增
`r157_universal_shape_audit/audit_web_majorant_r157.py`，并运行通过：

`R157_WEB_MAJORANT_ALGEBRA_PASSED`

`R157_WEB_MAJORANT_D5_FINITE_DOMINATION_PASSED`

`R157_WEB_GEOMETRY_HOLDER_BOOKKEEPING_PASSED`

`R157_WEB_HERMITE_BOUND_AND_SINGULAR_CONSTANTS_PASSED`

`R157_WEB_MAJORANT_AUDIT_COMPLETED`

复算值为 `T*=0.428757663860`、`s*=0.183833134319`，以及
`tau_safe(d=5)=0.069377900139`。审计还核对了 majorant 方程中容易出错的系数：
`m=0` 非线性项相对直接 pivot 只贡献 `1/3`，`m>=1` 项贡献 `1`，所以确实得到
`6b_n=[s^n](3cosh(sqrt(s))-2)B^3`，而不是把所有项粗略处理成同一比例。

当前应采用的证据分层：

`LOCAL-AUDITED / CONDITIONAL`：在既定 full-SF universal one-variable formal
reduction 前提下，majorant 代数、常数和已知低阶系数支配自洽；

`WEB-DRAFT / NOT YET INDEPENDENTLY PROVED`：解析半径、全阶 ordinary partial-sum
正性、Hermite completed bulk 正性和 first-failure lower rate 的整条定理链；

`OPEN`：reduction 的全阶适用性、formal-to-genuine-law 桥、所有 tau 的全局符号、
literal edge-escape B、full completed branch 的 bulk-negative A，以及原始
positive backward-OU exact zero-set rigidity。

这使 R157 成为目前最像“可整理成独立论文定理模块”的候选，但还不能声称已有
足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表成果。整体发表性结论继续为：

`无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）`。

### R158 全局审计任务已投递（2026-09-09）

本轮已向同一网页研究对话投递 R158，要求它基于当前公开记录完成全局理论脉络、
证据等级和发表性审计，并把 R157 整理成唯一下一目标。消息已经进入目标对话，
但网页端当前只记录了用户消息，没有生成新的数学回执；因此本轮不能把网页端的
R158 当作完成，也不能把“无回执”解释成数学结论。为避免重复轮次，下一次继续时
应先读取该对话的最新状态，再决定是否恢复发送。

本机对应的可直接阅读记录是
`r158_global_publication_audit/README.md`；当时记录的公开仓库基线为
`6ef72f1`，当前两条研究分支已更新至 `7f1435f`。该记录已经明确：R157 只到
`LOCAL-AUDITED ARITHMETIC / CONDITIONAL`，最小下一任务是闭合
`full-SF sparse completion -> universal equation -> majorant -> finite Hermite
density -> first-failure lower bound` 的接口；整体发表性结论保持：

`无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）`。

### R157 majorant 平方根奇点与大阶审计（2026-09-09）

在网页端尚未返回 R158 全局回执期间，本机继续推进 R157 的唯一技术接口。对

`F(s,B)=(3cosh(sqrt(s))-2)B^3-6B+5`

在临界点 `B*=5/4`、`s*=T*^2` 处做二阶隐函数展开，得到

`B(s)=5/4-K sqrt(1-s/s*)+O(1-s/s*)`,

`K=(25/32)sqrt(T* sinh(T*))`。

因此正 majorant 的系数 transfer law 为

`b_n ~ K/(2sqrt(pi)) s*^(-n)n^(-3/2)`。

本机在 `audit_web_majorant_r157.py` 中加入数值三重卷积递推，计算至 180 阶，
通过 `R157_WEB_MAJORANT_SQRT_SINGULARITY_ASYMPTOTIC_PASSED`；数值常数为
`K=0.340106372849`、`K/(2sqrt(pi))=0.095942236430`。该结果只属于正
majorant，不提供实际 `A_d` 系数的下界或相同大阶，因此仍不能解决
`n/M -> xi` 的 generalized-Hermite saddle，也不改变整体发表性结论。

### R158-A 条件性接口整理与本机核验（2026-09-09）

网页端 R158 全局审计消息及补充催办已经进入同一研究对话，但当前仍没有新的
理论回执。本机继续部署下一唯一技术接口，新增
`r158_interface_closure_audit/README.md` 与
`r158_interface_closure_audit/audit_r158_interface.py`，明确把

`full-SF sparse completion -> universal equation -> majorant -> zero-free disk
-> ordinary partial-sum positivity -> candidate first-failure rate`

写成条件性定理，并把 full-SF 全阶适用性、Hermite 归一化、formal-to-genuine-law
三项前提单独列出。新脚本精确核验 majorant 系数至 `b_10`、
`B*=5/4`、`D*=32/25`、`T*=0.428757663860...`、
`K=0.340106372849...` 与 `exp(-1/4)/8` 尺度转换；随后重跑 R157 原审计至阶
180，全部通过。

证据等级仍为 `PROVED UNDER STATED FORMAL REDUCTION / LOCAL-AUDITED` 加上
`CONDITIONAL / WEB-DRAFT`，并非 genuine law 或原始 rigidity 的证明。整体发表性
结论继续保持：

`无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）`。

本轮网页端没有生成回执，因此不再重复发送；下一次先读取同一对话的新状态，再
决定是否继续投递。

### R158-A 后续有限形式探针（2026-09-09）

网页端仍未生成 R159 理论回执。本机将 exact `D_3` Laurent recursion 的 `d=5`
形式分支延长到 `s^6`，得到
`a_6=0.000763969274987774`，相邻绝对值比从 `0.2705483`、`0.2909785`、
`0.3094066`、`0.3210496` 增至 `0.3282523`。该结果只说明低阶实际系数明显小于
正 majorant 的保守包络，属于 `FINITE-ONLY / EXPLORATORY`；不能推出实际收敛
半径、奇点或 generalized-Hermite 大阶律。整体发表性结论不变。

### R159 网页端投递与回执故障记录（2026-09-09）

基于本机最新提交 `9092591`，向同一历史研究对话投递了 R159，要求网页端读取
R158-A 接口记录，先完成全局证据分层，再逐行审查 full-SF universal equation
到 Hermite completed-formal 首失效下界的量词、归一化和最小缺口。消息曾显示为
处理中，但随后对话状态变为系统错误；读取最新记录确认没有生成新的 assistant
理论回答。连接诊断仍为绿色，因此本次只记录为网页端回执故障，不将其当作数学
结论，不新建对话，也不重复堆积用户消息。

### R158-A n=200 周期谱有限探针（2026-09-09）

为检查 `d=5` 真实系数是否只是正 majorant 的近似，本机新增
`r158_interface_closure_audit/probe_numeric_shape.py`。它在同一 formal universal
equation 下用周期角向平均递推 `A_5(s)` 至 `n=200`，采用 `L=4096` 等距角点；
前六项与 exact `D_3` Laurent recursion 的最大误差为 `5.551e-17`，换成
`L=8192` 后为 `4.163e-17`，且比值曲线一致到显示精度。符号在 `n=1,...,200`
全程交替；`rho_n=|a_(n-1)/a_n|` 在 `n=200` 为 `2.8130011640`，并从
`rho_60=2.8264353987`、`rho_100=2.8187138052`、`rho_150=2.8148980125`
逐步下降。

这只是有限形式的系数比值 proxy，不能推出 `A_5` 的收敛半径、奇点或 genuine
law。一次 `n=400` 普通双精度试跑发生下溢并产生 `NaN`，已剔除，不能当作数学
失败。证据等级保持 `FINITE-ONLY / EXPLORATORY`，整体发表性结论不变。

### R162 formal majorant lemma 的量词补全（2026-09-09）

R161 已投递到同一网页研究对话，但读取时仍只有用户消息，没有新的理论回执。
在等待期间，本机没有继续扩大低阶计算，而是把 R158-A 的核心接口补成可独立
引用的 formal lemma：对每个 `n` 明确假设 `q_i>=0`、`h_n>0`、总次数为 `n`
的混合矩 Hölder 上界，以及 `|p_d|^(2m)<=sum_i q_i^m`；随后把 universal
equation 的 `s^n` 系数拆成 `m=0` 去掉三个当前 linear terms 的余项和 `m>=1`
的 cosh 余项，逐项给出两个 majorant 上界，得到
`6b_n=[s^n]((3cosh(sqrt(s))-2)B^3)`。

这使 pivot `3h_n` 的正性、归纳只依赖低阶系数、以及常数 `6` 的来源都显式化。
同时补写了 odd-`d` 几何的直接证明：由 `r_1+r_2+r_3=0` 重排为
`a,b,-(a+b)` 后，`|a^d+b^d-(a+b)^d|<=(a+b)^d`；Hölder 则把总次数
`ell_1+ell_2+ell_3=n` 的混合矩压到 `h_n`。该 lemma 可作为论文中的条件性接口模块；它仍不补 full-SF 到 universal equation、
formal-to-genuine-law、全 `tau` 符号或原始 rigidity 的缺口。整体发表性判断不变。

### R163 网页端恢复尝试与状态（2026-09-09）

R163 以最新本机提交 `d943f5b` 为依据，要求网页端直接完成 formal majorant
lemma 的逐项证明审查。消息进入同一历史对话并短暂显示活动，随后网页端回到
系统错误；读取确认没有生成 assistant 理论正文。因此 R163 不计为数学成果，
也不把网页故障当作原始命题的 `OPEN` 证明。当前可用的数学证据仍以 R158-A
条件性 lemma 与本机审计为准。

### R164 回到 genuine backward charge cone 主轴（2026-09-09）

网页端 R163 仍无理论正文。本轮全局复盘后不继续扩大 R158-A 的 scalar
majorant，而重新接回 R99–R102：在 genuine full-exact 三拷贝 law 下，角向
Herglotz/Parseval 锥与 OU intertwining 给出
`sum_(m>=3|r|, m congruent r (mod 2)) t^(-m)|beta_(m,r)(g)|^2 <= 1`
对每个 genuine positive `t`-preimage 成立。若 `r=1` 且 `d` 是首个非零奇阶，
则 `beta_(d,1)=Lambda_d a_d`、`Lambda_d>0`，从而得到固定 asymmetric base 的
严格 backward 深度上界。

这条结果直接约束 positive backward preimage 的高 Hermite 系数，较 scalar
majorant 更接近原始命题。当前唯一缺口改写为 varying-bottom 情形下
`P_3K!=0` 是否迫使归一化 primitive angular charge 不塌缩；若不能，则需构造
满足全部 exact/positive 约束的 charge-collapse obstruction。R99–R102 已有公式
仍不能单独完成最终 rigidity。

### R164 网页端投递与回执状态（2026-09-09）

R164 将研究主线从 scalar majorant 重新接回 genuine backward charge cone，要求
网页端审查 `S_1(t)<=1`、首个奇阶 charge map，以及 varying-bottom 情形的
`P_3K`–primitive-charge 非退化问题。消息发送后读取同一网页历史仍未出现 R164，
线程回到系统错误。因此本轮没有网页理论正文可审计；R164 的数学内容只以本机
`e91cbf9` 的全局路线记录为准，不把投递状态当作证明。

### R165 全局脉络与发表性审计投递准备（2026-09-09）

读取同一网页研究对话确认 R164 仍没有 assistant 理论正文。为响应用户要求，下一
轮不再只追逐局部接口，而要求网页端先给出全局证据地图和诚实的发表性盘点：从原始
Positive Backward-Tower Exact Zero-Set Rigidity，经过 R99--R102 genuine charge
cone、R100/R132 的必要条件与局部证书、R133--R135 的 Jacobi/finite-row
obstruction，到 R157/R158-A 的 scalar formal majorant，逐项写清假设、定理、
证据等级、可写入论文的范围以及不能跨越的逻辑缺口。

本轮交接要求网页端明确区分 `P_3K` 零集等价、定量大小、`chi_1` charge、首个奇阶
Hermite 系数和原始 rigidity；若没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果，必须回答
“无”。全局盘点后只部署一个最小理论任务，即审查 varying-bottom 下
`P_3K` 到 primitive angular charge 的 uniform noncollapse（或给出最强的
charge-collapse obstruction），不再扩展无关数值计算。

### R165 网页端回执状态（2026-09-09）

R165 已成功写入同一网页历史，顶部显示完整消息；等待后读取确认网页端又回到
systemError，仍没有 assistant 理论正文。故 R165 只记为已投递的全局审计任务，
不记为理论成果，也不把系统故障解释为“发表性无”的数学证明。后续恢复网页端时
应先读取 R165 并审查其全局证据地图、发表性分层和唯一最小任务；在此之前不继续
扩展无关数值工作。

### R166 本机结构化简：varying-bottom tower 等价于 single-law exclusion（2026-09-09）

R165 仍无网页理论正文。本机先审查其 uniform noncollapse 目标，发现 genuine 类下
更基础且更强的等价关系：若存在一个 `P_3K` 非零的 genuine full-exact `L^2`
单律 `h`，则对任意 `q in (0,1)` 取
`g_N^(j)=P_(q^(N-j))h`，便得到任意深、正、exact 的 backward tower；
`||g_N^(0)-1||_2^2<=q^(3N)||h-1||_2^2`，且
`P_3K(g_N^(0);z)=P_3K(h;q^(N/2)z)` 对每个有限 N 仍非零。反向则显然：任意一层
非零 `P_3K` 本身就是 single-law witness。

因此原始 varying-bottom 存在性等价于“存在一个非对称 genuine exact 单律”（在
R102 的 log-MGF zero-set bridge 且原始 `P_3K` 采用该定义时）。同时
`S_3(t;P_s mu)=S_3(t/s;mu)`、
`tau_ang(P_s mu)=s tau_ang(mu)`，说明如果该单律存在，未归一化 charge 会沿 OU
轨道塌缩；uniform noncollapse 不能被当作独立的较弱目标。新模块
`r166_varying_bottom_reduction` 的纯结构审计通过后，需将网页端下一任务改为审查
此等价化简及其 genuine one-body factorization 缺口。

记号警告：若原始 `P_3K` 是空间 `log g` charge，而不是 R102 的 log-MGF charge，
R166 的 OU 非零保持尚未覆盖该对象；这成为单独的 persistence OPEN，不能把两种
`P_3K` 合并。

### R166 网页端回执状态（2026-09-09）

R166 已在同一网页历史顶部显示并短暂处于活动状态；等待后读取确认网页端回到
systemError，仍没有 assistant 理论正文。故 R166 只记为已投递任务，本机等价化简
和四项结构审计是当前唯一新增证据；网页端尚未对其证明或缺口作出判断。后续恢复
时先读取 R166，不再重复扩大数值或局部 minor。

### R168 空间 log-density charge 的局部 persistence（2026-09-09）

为避免 R166 把 log-MGF charge 的协变误当成原始空间 charge 的 persistence，本机
新增 `r168_spatial_ou_persistence_audit/README.md` 与 `audit_r168.py`。模块明确取
`ell_3^sp(g)=<log g,psi_3>`，并沿用 R132 的 genuine all-row local expansion：

`ell_3^sp(P_t h)=t^(3/2)m_3(h)/sqrt(6)+O(t^3)`。

若底层 genuine full-exact `h` 的 `m_3(h)!=0`，余项三角不等式给出某个 `t_h>0`
使 `ell_3^sp(P_t h)!=0` 对所有 `0<t<=t_h` 成立。固定 `q in (0,1)` 后，
`g_N^(j)=P_(q^(N-j))h` 形成任意深 positive exact tower，且
`||g_N^(0)-1||_2<=8q^(3N/2)`、`ell_3^sp(g_N^(0))!=0` 对充分大 `N` 成立。

这是 `PROVED UNDER STATED HYPOTHESES` 的局部离散 persistence lemma；审计脚本
通过主项/余项不等式、固定-q 指数、半群和 L2 收敛检查。它不构造 genuine 非高斯
exact law，不覆盖 `m_3=0` 的高 odd sector，也不证明原始 `P_3K` 就是 `ell_3^sp`。
因此不能替代 R102 的 log-MGF charge，也不能关闭 scalar `RK=1` 接口或最终 rigidity。

### R168 下一轮网页端全局审计要求（2026-09-09）

下一轮在继续本机局部工作之外，必须引导网页端先梳理全部脉络，逐模块明确：
已闭合的 genuine 必要条件、条件性接口、形式/有限探针、genuine obstruction、
仍然 OPEN 的桥，以及每项是否足以构成独立可审稿论文结果。网页端必须把
`RK=1`、full-exact/all-row、spatial `P_3K_sp`、`ell_3^sp`、`P_3K_MGF`、
`C_g`、`chi_1` 和首个 odd Hermite 系数分开；如果当前没有独立完整的发表性结果，
要明确回答“无”。网页端工作前必须读取 `THEORY_ROUTE_FRAMEWORK.md`、本工作日志、
`r158_global_publication_audit/README.md`、`r166_varying_bottom_reduction/README.md`
和 `r168_spatial_ou_persistence_audit/README.md`。

### R168 网页端回执状态（2026-09-09）

R168 全局审计消息在恢复导航后已成功写入同一网页研究历史顶部；等待后读取确认
线程再次回到 `systemError`，没有生成 assistant 理论正文。故本轮只记为“已投递、
未审查”，不把网页故障当作数学结论，也不把本机 R168 局部 lemma 升级为网页端
确认。若网页端恢复，应先读取该 R168 消息；在此之前不重复发送同一长任务，整体
发表性判断继续保持“无（目前没有足够独立、完整、可审稿的发表性结果）”。

### R169 空间 OU 轨道解析零点归约（2026-09-09）

R168 已在 `m_3(h)!=0` 子类给出固定-q 最终层非零。本机继续抽取一般结构：令
`F_h(r)=ell_3^sp(P_(r^2)h)`；若它在 `r=0` 附近解析且不恒等为零，则有限阶首项
`c_k r^k` 通过余项三角不等式保证 `F_h(q^(N/2))!=0` 对充分大 `N` 成立。配合
genuine full-exact 前向 OU 闭包和 R132 的
`||P_(q^N)h-1||_2<=8q^(3N/2)`，这给出任意深 spatial `ell_3` 非零 tower。

因此固定-q 离散零点不是核心障碍；真正最小缺口是证明空间 charge 轨道
non-flat，或构造满足全部 exact/positive 约束的 flat-orbit law。R169 的证据等级为
`PROVED UNDER STATED ANALYTIC HYPOTHESES`，审计脚本通过首项/余项、几何序列和
L2 指数检查；它不证明 `P_3K=ell_3^sp`，不处理 `m_3=0` 的 non-flatness，也不
改变整体发表性判断“无”。

### R170 首个非零 odd sector 的空间 non-flatness（2026-09-09）

本机在 R169 的解析零点归约上继续推进。对 genuine analytic full-SF law，若 `d`
是首个非零 odd cumulant，则 SF 偶阶递推先消去 `a_4,...,a_(2d-2)`。在空间
`ell_3^sp(P_(r^2)h)=<log(P_(r^2)h),psi_3>` 可逐项展开的假设下，`d=3` 有
`a_3r^3` 首项；`d>=5` 时线性项为零，唯一可能的 `r^(3d)` 二次 `(d,2d)` 通道
因 Hermite 度数 `d+3<2d` 无法投影到 `psi_3`，而三次 `(d,d,d)` 通道给出
`(T_d/3)a_d^3r^(3d)`，其中 `T_d=<psi_d^3,psi_3>>0`。因此空间 charge
轨道在该假设下必 non-flat，R169 的固定-q 最终层结论扩展到所有首个 odd sector。

`audit_r170.py` 通过组合式正性、二次度数排除、首个三次阶和 tower 缩放检查。
证据等级为 `PROVED UNDER STATED ANALYTIC FULL-SF HYPOTHESES`；空间逐项解析性、
原始 `P_3K` 定义、scalar `RK=1` 接口和 genuine asymmetric law existence/exclusion
仍 OPEN，整体发表性判断保持“无”。

### R170 网页端投递状态（2026-09-09）

R170 具体审查任务尝试发送到同一网页研究对话，但回读时历史顶部仍为 R169，线程
状态为 `systemError`，没有 R170 用户消息或 assistant 理论正文。因此网页端尚未
审查本机的 odd-sector non-flatness theorem；这不是数学上的否定。记录保持以本机
`audit_r170.py` 和提交 `49e9185` 为准，不重复投递同一任务；网页恢复后先确认
R170 是否进入历史。

### R171 用 exact-tail 推出有限阶 spatial log 渐近（2026-09-09）

本机继续削弱 R170 的完整解析性假设。由 Hermite 系数的 `L^p` 超收缩尾界，
R132 的 exact-row square-exponential tail/Mehler positivity 下界，以及 Mehler kernel
的 L2 Cauchy-Schwarz 上界，可在 `|u_r|<=1/2` 与补集上分别控制三阶 log Taylor
余项，得到 `o(r^(3d))` 的有限阶渐近；不需要完整 complex analyticity。

对 `d>=5`，SF 消去 `4,...,2d-2` 的 even modes；首个 odd mode后 odd tail至少从
`d+2` 起，剩余 even tail至少从 `2d` 起。二次 `(d,2d)` 投影因 `d+3<2d` 为零，
三次项的唯一 leading channel 是 `(d,d,d)`，系数为严格正的
`T_d a_d^3/3`。R171 因而把 R170 的 spatial non-flatness 推进到
`Genuine all-row + full-SF + finite tail estimates` 条件下。

`audit_r171.py` 通过模式间隔、组合式正性、余项阶数和 tower 缩放检查；证据等级为
`PROVED UNDER STATED GENUINE ALL-ROW + FULL-SF HYPOTHESES`。网页端仍需审查完整的
weighted-tail 估计；原始 `P_3K` 定义、scalar `RK=1` 接口和 genuine asymmetric law
存在/排除仍 OPEN，整体发表性判断保持“无”。

### R171 网页端投递状态（2026-09-09）

R171 具体审查任务尝试发送到同一网页研究对话，但回读历史仍为 R170，线程状态为
`systemError`，没有 R171 用户消息或 assistant 理论正文。故网页端尚未审查 R171；
本机 tail-based 有限阶证明以提交 `44e77a4` 为准，不把网页故障当作数学结论，也
不重复投递同一任务。

### R172 原始 `P_3K` 的对象溯源审计（2026-09-09）

本轮新增 `r172_p3k_provenance_audit/README.md` 与 `audit_r172.py`，把此前容易
发生的对象偷换显式列为一个独立 OPEN 接口。空间
`ell_3^sp=<log g,psi_3>`、Bargmann `C_g=log B_g`、R102 analytic
`P_3K_MGF` 以及 R101 angular `chi_1`/`beta_(m,1)` 各自的定义、假设和证据等级
不同；R101 已明示 angular charge 与 `P_3 K` 分离，R133 已明示 `C_g` 与空间
`log g` 不可混同。因此当前不能声称原始 `P_3K` 已被其中任一对象识别，不能把
R168–R171 空间结论直接落回原始命题，也不能把 R166 log-MGF 化简推广到空间线。

本机审计结论为：R102 是原始 `P_3K` 的最强工作重建，但早期 R4 来源的完全核验仍为
`OPEN/UNRESOLVED PROVENANCE`。R99–R102、R132–R133、R168–R171
仍保留为各自假设下的 genuine 必要条件、结构 lemma 或 conditional theorem；但
截至 R172，独立、完整、可审稿的原始问题发表性结果仍为“无”。网页端下一轮必须
先读取全框架和本工作日志，明确恢复/否认原始 `P_3K` 定义，逐项标出 `PROVED`、
`CONDITIONAL`、`FORMAL`、`OBSTRUCTION`、`OPEN`，再决定下一条最小数学推进；不得
把“消息已发送”或网页错误当作理论回执。

### R172 网页端回执状态（2026-09-09）

R172 全局审计任务已进入同一历史对话，但回读显示线程立即为 `systemError`，没有
assistant 理论正文。故网页端尚未完成本轮全局梳理；本机记录为“已投递、无理论回执”，
不把网页错误当数学否定，也不把投递成功升级为审查完成。后续如网页恢复，应先读取
R172 用户消息，再逐项返回全局证据分层、原始 `P_3K` provenance、发表性判断和单一
下一步；在此之前继续以 `7a1a731` 的本机审计为准。

### R173 首个 odd sector 的 linear-window positive backward cone（2026-09-09）

本机依据历史记录修正 R172 的 provenance 表述：R102 已由网页端从早期 R4
恢复出 analytic log-MGF 形式的 `P_3K`，但早期 R4 原文不在当前仓库，因此准确
状态是“R102 工作定义已恢复、来源完全核验 OPEN”。R102/R166 可继续作为原始
charge 的工作分支；仍不得把它们偷换为空间 `ell_3^sp`、Bargmann `C_g` 或 R101
angular `chi_1`。

在该分支上新增 `r173_linear_window_backward_cone/README.md` 与 `audit_r173.py`。
对 genuine centered/variance-one full-exact law，若 `d` 是首个非零 odd Hermite
阶，且 full-SF 偶阶递推消去 `a_4,...,a_(2d-2)`，则所有 odd `d<=m<3d` 的
cubic angular charge 都无 nonlinear mixing：
`beta_(m,1)=Lambda_m a_m`，其中 `Lambda_m>0`。因此任何 genuine positive
`t`-preimage 都满足 finite-window 预算
`sum_(m odd,d<=m<3d)Lambda_m^2 t^(-m)a_m(g)^2<=1`，特别是
`|a_d(g)|<=t^(d/2)/Lambda_d`。在 R102 工作定义下，这等价给出
`|[z^d]P_3K_MGF(g;z)|<=t^(d/2)/sqrt(d!)`。本轮不额外主张角向 cone 的严格号。

这条结果的证据等级为 `PROVED UNDER GENUINE FULL-EXACT + FULL-SF HYPOTHESES`，
本机精确 degree/parity support audit 已通过。它把 R101 的全阶 cone 具体化为
首个 odd sector 的整段高 Hermite 约束，但不能阻止 `d_N` 随塔深度逃向无穷，也不
能关闭 bare `RK=1` 接口或最终 rigidity；整体独立完整发表性结论仍为“无”。

### R173 网页端回执状态（2026-09-09）

R173 审查任务已尝试发送到同一历史对话，但回读仍停留在 R172，未出现 R173
用户消息或 assistant 理论正文，线程此前状态为 `systemError`。故网页端尚未审查
这条高阶 cone lemma；本机只记录“未获理论回执”，不把网页故障当成数学否定。若
网页恢复，下一次应先读取 R173，再审查 `d<=m<3d` 的 no-mixing 与 `d_N` escape
缺口；在此之前以本机提交为准。

### R174 `2d` 阶 cross-harmonic backward wall（2026-09-09）

R173 之后本机把 same-factor identity 推到首个 nonlinear threshold。用 D3 根滤波
系数 `c_(n,r)=3*6^(-n/2)binom(n,(n-3r)/2)`，支持分类给出
`beta_(2d,2)=L_d a_(2d)+Q_d a_d^2`，其中
`Q_d=sqrt((2d)!)/d!*(H_d-L_d)/2`。若存在 genuine positive `t`-preimage，则
`|L_d a_(2d)(g)+Q_d a_d(g)^2|<=t^d`。full-SF 的 `z^(2d)` 系数比较又给出
`a_(2d)=sqrt((2d)!)/(2*d!)*(1-B_d/A_d)a_d^2`，从而
`|C_d|a_d(g)^2<=t^d`，其中
`C_d=sqrt((2d)!)/(2*d!)*(H_d-L_dB_d/A_d)`。

`r174_cross_harmonic_2d_wall/audit_r174.py` 已精确核验支持、闭合公式及
`d=3,5,7` 的正性常数。证据等级为 `PROVED UNDER GENUINE FULL-EXACT + FULL-SF`
（所有 `d` 的 `C_d>0` 仍 OPEN）；该 wall 不能关闭 `d_N` escape、bare `RK=1`
接口或最终 rigidity，整体发表性结论仍为“无”。

### R174 网页端回执状态（2026-09-09）

R174 审查任务经后续回读已进入网页历史，但仍未出现 assistant 理论正文。因此本轮
只记录本机的 cross-harmonic 精确公式和 `d=3,5,7` 有限实例审计；不把消息进入历史
当作理论回执。所有 `d` 的 `C_d>0` 仍为 OPEN。

### R175 `C_d>0` 的单一组合缺口（2026-09-09）

本机继续处理 R174 的全阶正性，而不是扩大 Hermite 展开。对 odd `d` 定义
`J_d={j:0<=j<=d, j=-d (mod 3)}`、`u_j=binom(d,j)`、
`S_0=sum_{J_d}u_j^2` 和 `S_3=sum_{j,j+3 in J_d}u_j u_(j+3)`。换元
`j=(d-3r)/2` 后，精确得到 `B_d=9*6^(-d)S_0`、`H_d=9*6^(-d)S_3`，以及
`L_d/A_d=d(d-1)(d-2)/((d+1)(d+2)(d+3))`。故 `C_d>0` 等价于整数 gap

`Delta_d=((d+1)(d+2)(d+3))S_3-d(d-1)(d-2)S_0>0`。

新增 `r175_all_d_cross_constant_audit/README.md` 和 `audit_r175.js`，用 BigInt
逐个精确核验 odd `3<=d<=501` 的 `Delta_d>0`。这把 R174 的所有 `d` 正性压缩
成一个明确的模 3 二项式相关不等式；但有限核验不是全阶证明，且 gap 随 `d` 很快
变小。证据等级为 `PROVED EXACT REDUCTION + LOCALLY EXACT-AUDITED`；
`Delta_d>0` 对所有 odd `d`、`d_N` 逃逸、bare `RK=1` 接口和原始 `P_3K` 身份仍
OPEN，整体发表性判断仍为“无”。

### R176：所有 odd `d` 的 `C_d>0`（2026-09-09）

本轮找到并核验了 R175 组合缺口的全阶证明。令 `omega^3=1`、`d=2s+1`，
`Q(x)=(1+x)(1+omega*x)`，`q_m=[x^m]Q(x)^d`。root-of-unity filter 给出
`S_0=(A+2X)/3`、`S_3=(T+2Y)/3`，其中 `X=omega^d q_d`、
`Y=omega^d q_(d-3)`、`A=binom(2d,d)`、`T=binom(2d,d-3)`，从而
`Delta_d=(2/3)(D Y-n X)`，`n=d(d-1)(d-2)`、`D=(d+1)(d+2)(d+3)`。

作 `x=omega(1+y)/2` 后有 `Q(x)=(y^2+3)/4`。由于 `Q(x)^d` 只含偶次 `y`
幂，中心系数的展开中所有非零项同号：`X<0`，并且
`Z=omega^(d-1)q_(d-1)>0`。由 `Qq'=dQ'q` 在中心附近的三项递推，精确得到

`omega^d(Dq_(d-3)-nq_d)=d*((d+1)^2 Z+d(5-d)X)`。

对 `d>=5` 右端严格为正（第一项正，第二项非负）；`d=3` 直接为 `162`。因而
`Delta_d>0`，进而 R174 的 `C_d>0` 对所有 odd `d>=3` 成立，而非只对
`d=3,5,7`。新增 `r176_all_d_cross_constant_positivity/README.md` 和
`audit_r176.js`，用整数等式核验该推导及 odd `3<=d<=501`。

证据等级升级为 `PROVED UNDER GENUINE FULL-EXACT + FULL-SF` 的全阶
cross-harmonic wall；这仍不是原始题设的完整解，因为 `RK=1=>full-exact/all-row`
及原始 `P_3K` identification、`d_N` escape 和非 Gaussian genuine exact law
仍 OPEN。整体独立完整发表性判断暂不改变，仍为“无”。

### R177：all-`d` wall 的显式系数下界（2026-09-09）

R176 的符号证明还可保留一个正项，给出可代入 backward wall 的显式尺度。对
`d=2s+1>=5`，令 `Z_d=omega^(d-1)[x^(d-1)]((1+x)(1+omega*x))^d`，则
`Delta_d >= (2/3)d(d+1)^2 Z_d`，而中心展开的 `k=s` 项给出
`Z_d>=2^(-d-1)binom(d,s)3^(s+1)`。因此

`C_d >= sqrt((2d)!)/(2*d!) * 6*d*(d+1)/((d+2)(d+3))
       * 2^(-2d-1)*3^(-s)*binom(d,s)`。

若 `g=P_t h` 属于 genuine full-exact/full-SF 类且 `d` 为首个非零 odd 阶，仍有
`C_d a_d(g)^2<=t^d`；对 `g_N^(0)=P_(q^N)h_N` 则为
`C_(d_N)a_(d_N)(g_N^(0))^2<=q^(N*d_N)`。新增 `r177_quantitative_cross_wall`
并以整数算术核验 `d=5,7,...,501`，另核验 `d=3` 基例。该下界随 `d` 衰减，
所以只把 `d_N` 逃逸写得更清楚，不声称已经消灭它；整体发表性判断仍为“无”。

### R176 网页端回执状态（2026-09-09）

R176 两次投递中，第二次短消息已进入 `理论推进审计` 历史，但网页线程再次返回
`systemError`，没有 assistant 理论正文。故 R176 的全阶证明和 R177 定量推论均以
本机记录与审计为准，网页端仍未完成审查；不把消息进入历史升级为理论回执。

### R177 网页端回执状态（2026-09-09）

R177 的短消息未在网页历史中形成新的理论回执；线程仍停留在 R176 消息并返回
`systemError`。本机因此不重复发送长提示，也不把 R177 的 Git 提交或本机审计当作
网页审查完成。当前网页恢复后的首要任务仍是读取 R176/R177，并从全局路线中选择
一个最小接口继续推导。

### R178：cross-wall 系数的 Stirling 尺度（2026-09-09）

把 R177 的显式下界写成 `d=2s+1` 后，得到
`underlineC_d=[3d(d+1)/((d+2)(d+3))]2^(-2d-1)3^(-s)
sqrt((2d)!)/(s!(s+1)!)`。带余项的 Stirling 展开给出

`underlineC_d ~ 3/(sqrt(2)*pi^(3/4)) * d^(-3/4) * 3^(-s)`。

因此 genuine full-exact/full-SF 下的 R177 wall 可写成
`a_d(g)^2 <= O(d^(3/4)(sqrt(3)*t)^d)`；在 `t=q^N` 时为
`O(d_N^(3/4)(sqrt(3)q^N)^(d_N))`。这是对 moving-degree escape 代价的定量
包络，而不是系数的下界，不能排除首 odd 系数同步变小。R178 仍保持
`PROVED UNDER GENUINE FULL-EXACT + FULL-SF` 的条件性等级，整体发表性判断仍为“无”。

### R175 网页端回执状态（2026-09-09）

R175 经过一次短消息恢复重试后已进入同一网页研究历史，但网页线程再次返回
`systemError`，没有生成 assistant 理论正文。因此本轮只记录本机 R175 的精确
组合化简与 `d<=501` BigInt 审计；不把消息入历史、连接自检通过或新提交当作网页
理论回执。网页恢复后应先读取 R175，再审查 `Delta_d>0` 的全阶证明；整体发表性
判断继续保持“无”。

### R178 网页端回执状态（2026-09-09）

R178 短提示未进入网页历史；回读仍停留在 R177，网页线程没有生成 assistant 理论
正文。本轮因此不再重复投递，R178 只记为本机已推导、已做尺度 sanity check、网页
未审查；桥接自检正常不等于网页理论回执。

### R179：OU 齐次 backward wall 的 no-go（2026-09-09）

网页端 R179 发送调用返回成功但没有进入历史，线程随后仍返回 `systemError`；这不是
数学回执。本机转而把下一条真正的理论推进写成 `r179_homogeneous_wall_scale_no_go`：
若存在一个 genuine full-exact 非高斯 exact law `h`，且类对前向 OU 闭包，则
`g_N^(j)=P_(q^(N-j))h` 自动生成任意深塔。对 Hermite/角向系数的标准权重，任意
齐次多项式都按其总 Hermite grade 缩放；故 R173 的 cone budget、R176/R177 的
`C_d a_d(g)^2<=t^d` 在 `g=P_t h` 上分别精确约化为 `N` 无关的底层约束。

这给出 `PROVED UNDER STATED GENUINE HYPOTHESES` 的尺度型 no-go：继续提高齐次
backward wall 的阶数或改善 `C_d` 渐近，不能单独排除 varying-bottom；必须回到单个
genuine exact law 的排除、formal-to-genuine 尾部桥、bare `RK=1=>all-row`，或
原始 `P_3K` 对象溯源。`audit_r179.js` 用有理数精确核验各类缩放恒等式；整体发表性
判断仍为“无”。

### R180：无限 odd tail escape dichotomy（2026-09-09）

网页端 R180 发送调用返回成功但仍未形成历史正文；本机不把它当作理论回执。为继续
单律主轴，本机合并 R137、R138 与 R150 得到结构性 reduction：在 genuine
full-exact/full-SF、全阶尾界和局部 MGF 解析假设下，任何 asymmetric law 都必须有
无穷多个非零 odd cumulants；若 odd support 有限，则 `K_o` 是 odd polynomial，而
`|K_o(t)|<=A+B t^2` 强迫其为零。另一方面，非对称性要求存在有限半径的非配对 MGF
零点，且
`limsup_(m odd)(|kappa_m|/(m-1)!)^(1/m)=1/R_Delta>0`。

再结合 R150 的 fixed-degree robust Hankel replenishment：首 odd 系数 `c_d=a` 固定
后，高 odd 系数不能在某个有限窗口内全部小于 `eta_d(a)`。因此若原始命题失败，
其 genuine law 必须同时进入“无限 odd、非配对零点、有限窗口高 odd replenishment”
的窄逃逸类；OU 平滑只把零点推向 `zeta/sqrt(t)` 并同步压低每个固定系数。

这仍不是反例或最终排除，而是把 OPEN single-law 问题进一步压缩成“证明该无限尾
escape 与正密度/全阶 Hankel cone 不相容，或构造满足所有条件的 genuine law”二选一。
证据等级为 `PROVED UNDER STATED GENUINE HYPOTHESES` 加 `SYNTHESIS/CONDITIONAL`；
`audit_r180.js` 已通过精确代数 sanity check，整体发表性判断仍为“无”。

### R181：Cauchy odd-tail / Hankel replenishment bridge（2026-09-09）

网页端 R181 发送调用成功但未形成理论正文；本机继续推进定量接口。令
`C_o(z)=(C(z)-C(-z))/2`，在 Hadamard 非配对零点假设下，成对零点在 `C_o` 中
抵消，故对 `rho<R_Delta` 有 `M_o(rho)=max_|z|=rho |C_o(z)|` 与
`|c_n|<=M_o(rho)rho^(-n)`。结合 R150 的 robust replenishment，某个
`d<n<2M_d(a)` 满足 `|c_n|>eta_d(a)`，从而得到

`eta_d(a)<M_o(rho) max_(d<n<2M_d(a), n odd)rho^(-n)`；

当 `rho>=1` 时尤其有 `eta_d(a)<=M_o(rho)rho^(-(d+2))`。这把非配对零点解析
尺度与正性/Hankel 高 odd 补偿放进同一精确不等式，明确剩余缺口是 `M_o`、`M_d`
和 `eta_d` 在 `d->infinity,a->0` 下的联合 uniform 比较，而不是再做低阶扫描。

OU 缩放 `C_(o,t)(z)=C_o(sqrt(t)z)`、`R_Delta(t)=R_Delta/sqrt(t)` 说明同步
选取 Cauchy 半径时该不等式仍只是底层约束，不会关闭塔。证据等级为
`PROVED UNDER HADAMARD + R150 HYPOTHESES`，审计 marker 为
`R181_CAUCHY_REPLENISHMENT_BRIDGE_PASSED`；整体发表性判断仍为“无”。

### R182：第一非配对零点壳的正下密度 odd-tail 下界（2026-09-09）

网页端 R182 发送调用成功但未形成理论正文；本机继续推进零点尾接口。若第一
非配对零点壳半径为 `R_Delta`，重数差为 `delta_j`，则归一化 odd cumulants 是
有限单位圆指数和 `A_k`。Cesàro 正交性给出 `mean|A_k|^2=S_2=sum|delta_j|^2`；
由 `|A_k|<=B=sum|delta_j|`，至少有下密度
`p_0=(S_2/2)/(B^2-S_2/2)` 的阶次满足 `|A_k|>=sqrt(S_2/2)`。第一壳外的
严格半径间隙使其误差指数衰减，故在正下密度子序列上

`|kappa_(2k+1)|/(2k)! >= (sqrt(S_2/2)/2)R_Delta^(-(2k+1))`。

这比单纯 limsup 更强，排除了“odd tail 只在极稀疏阶次出现”的逃逸；但第一壳
半径、壳强度与 R150 的 `eta_d(a)` 仍无联合 uniform 控制，故尚未关闭无限尾
escape。`audit_r182.js` 已通过周期指数和、密度估计、外壳衰减和 OU 换元审计；
整体发表性判断仍为“无”。

### R183：scale-free shell-to-cone obstruction（2026-09-09）

网页端 R183 发送后再次出现 `systemError`，未形成理论正文；本机新增
`r183_scale_free_shell_cone_obstruction`。对 `J` 个等权单位根
`A_k^(J)=sum_(j=0)^(J-1) exp(2*pi*i*j*k/J)`，离散 Fourier 正交性给出
`A_k=J`（`J|k`）或 `0`（否则）。于是 `S_2=B=J`、R182 的通用密度下界
为 `p_0=1/(2J-1)`，而实际可见阶次密度是 `1/J`；平均二次能量保持非零，
但任意固定有限阶窗口在 `J` 足够大时完全 cancellation。归一化为
`b_j=1/sqrt(J)` 后仍有 `S_2=1`、`B^2/S_2=J`，说明 shell energy、Cauchy
上界和 OU 缩放不能单独给出 uniform shell-to-Hankel/cone coercivity。

该族是精确的 finite-shell obstruction model，不是 genuine MGF 反例；R183
把唯一缺口具体化为首壳模态数/`B^2/S_2` 的统一控制、shell-to-cone coercive
不等式或 `eta_d(a)` 的 moving-degree 下界。`audit_r183.js` 已通过；整体
发表性判断仍为“无”。

### R184：Jensen 零点计数与 small-shell regime（2026-09-09）

网页端 R184 发送后暂未形成理论正文；本机继续推进 R183 的唯一缺口。R112 的
genuine full-exact envelope `E exp(X^2/8)<=2` 对 normalized Bargmann MGF 给出
`|B_mu(x+iy)|<=2 exp(3|z|^2/2)`。Jensen 在 `r=1,R=2` 上于是给出
`n_mu(1)<10`，即首个非配对壳若 `R_Delta<=1`，其代表数 `J<=9`。因此
`B^2/S_2<=J<=9`、`p_0>=1/17`；若重数差为整数且壳非空，`S_2>=1`，R182
的首壳主项归一化幅度至少为 `1/sqrt(2)`；扣除外壳误差后，最终显示的
odd-cumulant 下界常数为 `1/(2sqrt(2))`（阶次起点仍可能依赖 law）。

若 `R_Delta>1`，forward OU 不能取 `t=R_Delta^2`；直接 Jensen 只给出
`J<=1+(6/log 2)R_Delta^2` 和
`p_0>=1/(1+(12/log 2)R_Delta^2)`，故大壳区间仍可退化。R184 把当前
analytic escape 缩小为大壳或 uniform shell-gap/onset/degree-alignment 问题，
但尚未把 `p_0>=1/17` 对齐到 R150 的 `eta_d(a)`，整体发表性判断仍为“无”。
`audit_r184.js` 已通过。

### R185：phase collision 与 replenishment window 起始阶次（2026-09-09）

网页端 R185 发送后暂未形成理论正文；本机新增
`r185_phase_collision_onset_obstruction`。即使 R184 已得 `J<=9` 和
`p_0>=1/17`，首壳相位仍可近碰撞。取共轭单位根
`lambda=(e^(i theta),e^(-i theta),e^(i(theta+delta)),e^(-i(theta+delta)))`
及整数权 `b=(1,1,-1,-1)`，则 `J=4,S_2=B=4,p_0=1/7` 固定，但
`A_k=2(cos(k theta)-cos(k(theta+delta)))` 满足 `|A_k|<=2k delta`。
因此任意有限 window `[0,L]` 都能由 `delta<=eta/(2L)` 完全压低；看到固定
幅度 `alpha` 的起始阶至少为 `alpha/(2delta)`。这说明 R184 的 uniform density
不能对齐 R150 的 finite window，真正缺口是 genuine phase separation、
Vandermonde lower bound 或直接的 shell-to-Hankel onset estimate。模型满足
real-conjugation/整数 shell data，但不构成 genuine MGF 反例；审计已通过，
整体发表性仍为“无”。

### R186：primitive inverse-Hankel rank-escape dichotomy（2026-09-09）

网页端 R186 重发调用返回线程标识，但复核显示未写入历史，线程仍停在 R185
`systemError`；本机不把它当网页端理论回执。为回到全局主轴，本机新增
`r186_primitive_rank_escape_dichotomy`，收紧 R13–R15 的量词：对每个 genuine
primitive law 和固定 `r>1`，inverse-OU formal Hankel 链必在有限阶失败，否则
Hamburger + Carleman 会产生正的 `r`-backward preimage，违反 primitiveness；但
若 primitive laws 在统一 square-exponential 包络下收敛到 Gaussian，则每个
固定 Hankel 阶最终严格正定，故失败阶必满足 `M_r(pi_N)->infinity`。

这把全局 Bochner-tail escape 精确压缩为 uniform inverse-Hankel rank closure，
也说明 depth decay 只控制 OU amplitude，不控制 primitive shape。该结论是
R13–R15 的 global quantifier consolidation，不是原始 rigidity；`P_3K`、
bare `RK=1` 到 genuine full-exact/all-row 和 spatial bridge 仍分离。审计已通过，
整体发表性判断仍为“无”。

### R187：sector-wise Parseval 不蕴含 global inverse-tail tightness（2026-09-09）

网页端 R187 已发送；本机新增 `r187_spectral_tail_migration_obstruction`。
固定 `r>1`，令每轮唯一非零 mixed coefficient 为
`C_(1,N)=r^(-(2N+1))`。则每个固定 `ell` 的 inverse-OU 加权 sector 预算均
有界，`ell=0` 仍完全为零而不触犯 `T~Exp(1)` 的 marginal 正交性；但对任意
固定 cutoff `M`，取 `N>M` 时总 weighted tail 恰为 `1`。故 sector-wise
Parseval 不能升级为跨 `(ell,n)` 的 uniform spectral-tail tightness。

该族是抽象 coefficient obstruction，不是 genuine full-exact law；它把
R186 的 rank escape 缺口具体化为 `U|T` mixed conditional structure 或
total-degree budget。若 genuine class 能证明 inverse-weighted total tail
紧性，再结合有限坐标连续性即可闭合 primitive stratum；目前整体发表性仍为
“无”，审计已通过。

### R188：conditional-moment projection 与 mixed-sector tail interface（2026-09-09）

本机新增 `r188_mixed_sector_projection`，把 R187 的跨 sector 缺口精确定义为
`m_ell(t)=E[psi_ell(U)|T=t]` 的总次数尾部条件
`lim_(M->infinity)sup_j sum_(2n+ell>M)r^(4n+2ell)|C_(ell,n)(mu_j)|^2=0`。
由 Laguerre 投影、OU 对角化和有限块加尾部，严格得到：固定坐标逐项收敛加该
条件时，inverse-weighted mixed coefficient 向量在 `ell^2` 中收敛。该接口仍不
自动产生 genuine backward preimage，正性/同因子 realization 另行 OPEN。

同时构造了正联合密度
`phi(u)e^(-t)[1+epsilon*tanh(u)*b_N(t)]`：保持 `U~N(0,1)` 与 `T~Exp(1)`
两个边缘不变，却可使 `C_(1,n)=0`（`n<N`）而 `C_(1,N)!=0`。其中 `b_N`
是 `[0,A]` 上 `L_N` 去除低阶 Laguerre 投影后的有界 remainder。它不是
three-iid same-factor genuine counterexample，但证明径向边缘本身确实看不见
任意高 mixed Laguerre 阶；下一步必须从 product density 结构证明 total-degree
预算，或构造满足 all-degree exactness 的 genuine migration。整体发表性判断仍为
“无”，审计已通过。

### R190：Gaussian 点上的 full mixed Laguerre 一阶盲区（2026-09-09）

本机新增 `r190_linearized_radial_blind_ladder`。在 Gaussian product law 处，
对 formal odd tangent `h_(2n+1)=H_(2n+1)`（`n>=1`），任意径向测试
`F(Q)` 的一阶变化都因全局反射而为零；但 `C_(1,n)=E[U L_n(T)]` 的一阶
变化精确为
`sqrt(3)(2n+1)!(-1)^n/(3^n n!)`，对每个 `n` 非零。闭式来自
`E[L_n(T)exp(sR_1-s^2/2)]=(-s^2/2)^n/n!`。

这把 R188 的缺口进一步收紧：径向 exact identity 的线性化不仅看不见某个
低阶 odd charge，而是看不见整个 `ell=1` mixed Laguerre ladder；要证明
`(MT_r)` 必须使用 genuinely nonlinear 的 same-factor coupling 与 positivity。
该结论是 `PROVED` 的 Gaussian generating-function calculation 加
`FORMAL LINEARIZED OBSTRUCTION`，不是 genuine exact-law counterexample；整体
原始问题的独立发表性判断仍为“无”，审计已通过。

### R191：二阶 radial product identity 的可抵消 jet（2026-09-09）

本机新增 `r191_second_order_radial_cancellation`。对任意 odd `d>=3`，在
Gaussian characteristic factor 上取 formal jet
`phi_epsilon=phi_0 exp(epsilon(iu)^d+epsilon^2 kappa_d u^(2d)+...)`。
令 `S_d=sum_j a_j^d`、`A_d=<sum_j a_j^(2d)>`、`B_d=<S_d^2>`，则
`kappa_d=B_d/(2A_d)>0` 使
`<prod_j phi_epsilon(a_j u)>=exp(-u^2/2)+O(epsilon^3)` 逐点成立；
而 R190 的 `D C_(1,n)`（`d=2n+1`）仍非零。二项式闭式为
`A_d=3 binom(2d,d)/6^d`、`B_d=9S0_d/6^d`，
`S0_d=sum_{d-2k=0 mod 3}binom(d,k)^2`。

因此二阶 radial response 仍可被 even one-body correction 抵消，不能自动形成
mixed-sector 正 coercivity。该结论是 `PROVED` 的二阶代数 calculation 加
`FORMAL SECOND-ORDER NO-GO`，不是 genuine positive-definite characteristic
branch；整体发表性判断仍为“无”，审计已通过。

### R192：all-order formal radial lift of an odd mixed direction（2026-09-09）

本机新增 `r192_all_order_formal_radial_lift`。固定 odd `d>=3`，令
`S_k(theta)=sum_j a_j(theta)^k`，并取 one-body characteristic log jet
`log(phi_epsilon/phi_0)=sum_(k>=1)epsilon^k b_k(iu)^(kd)`、`b_1=1`。
第 `m` 阶 angular 系数中，若 `m` odd，所有 monomial 因
`theta->theta+pi` 自动平均为零；若 `m` even，唯一新项的系数是
`i^(md)A_(md)`，其中 `A_k=3 binom(k,k/2)/6^(k/2)>0`。故可递归选择
`b_m` 消掉每个 even 阶，得到 formal all-order radial-preserving jet，且
R190 的任意指定 `D C_(1,n)` 仍非零。

这是真正比 R191 更强的 `PROVED formal recursion + FORMAL ALL-ORDER NO-GO`：
angular radial identity 单独不能在形式层面排除 odd mixed direction。它未证明
positive-definiteness、收敛或 genuine all-degree law；原始问题整体发表性仍为
“无”，审计已通过。

### R193：finite-PSD witness escape 与全局成果审计接口（2026-09-09）

本机在 R192 之后只推进正定性，不再增加 radial Taylor 阶数。令
`G_0(T)=(exp(-(t_a-t_b)^2/2))`。对任意互异有限点集，Fourier 表示
`c^*G_0c=(2pi)^(-1/2) integral exp(-xi^2/2)|sum c_a exp(i xi t_a)|^2 dxi`
给出严格正定。因而在固定 `m`、固定频率范围 `[-U,U]`、且最小点间距
`delta>0` 的紧配置族上，Gaussian Gram 最小特征值有统一正下界；R192 的任何
局部一致小扰动在足够小 `epsilon` 下都保持 PSD。这严格排除了固定非退化有限
Gram 主子式以统一负裕量击破 formal jet。

另一方面，有限阶截断的对数若含次数大于二的非零多项式，则在经典
Marcinkiewicz 定理下不是特征函数；由 Bochner 判据它必有某个有限 Gram 负性
见证。两者合并为 escape dichotomy：见证随 `epsilon->0` 必须向频率无穷、Gram
阶数无穷、点碰撞/导数型退化或负裕量趋零中的至少一个方向逃逸。该结论是
`PROVED` 的 finite Gaussian PSD stability 加 `CONDITIONAL/CLASSICAL INPUT`
的 finite-truncation non-characteristic 结论，不是 genuine counterexample，
也不证明 R192 infinite formal series 收敛。

R193 与 R186 同属正性检测阶逃逸，但前者是 Bochner 频率/Gram 层，后者是
inverse-Hankel moment 层；不循环。它把 R192 后真正剩余的接口压缩为
confluent-Bochner/导数核检验，继而才可能与 R186 rank closure、R188 `(MT_r)`
拼接。全局成果审计结论仍为：原始 rigidity OPEN，bare `RK=1` 桥、原始
`P_3K` 身份桥、`(MT_r)` 与 primitive closure 未闭合；截至此轮独立完整发表性
仍为“无”。`audit_r193.js` 已通过。

### R194：confluent-Bochner 导数阶逃逸（2026-09-09）

本机继续处理 R193 唯一剩余的点碰撞通道。将趋近点集的归一化有限差分 Gram
极限写成导数核
`H_ab(t)=partial_x^a partial_y^b Phi(x-y)|_(x=y=t)`，其 PSD 等价于
特征测度的有限 moment Hankel PSD。Gaussian 基点满足
`c^*H_n(0)c=E|sum_a c_a X^a|^2>0`，故每个固定导数阶 `n` 都有严格有限谱隙；
任何在零点附近导数到阶 `2n` 连续趋于 Gaussian 的 R192 truncation/genuine
候选，在足够小 `epsilon` 下仍保持该导数核块正定。

因此 R193 的点碰撞若真的承载有限截断的非特征性见证，其归一化后的导数阶
必须 `n->infinity`，或负裕量趋零、归一化退化、中心频率逃逸。R194 是
`PROVED` 的 confluent PSD 与固定阶稳定性，加经典 Marcinkiewicz–Bochner 的
有限截断条件见证；不是 genuine counterexample。它与 R186 的 inverse-Hankel
failure-order escape 结构相似但层次不同，不循环。原始 `RK=1` 桥、`P_3K`
身份桥、`(MT_r)`、uniform rank closure 和 tower rigidity 仍 OPEN，整体发表性
仍为“无”。`audit_r194.js` 已通过。

### R195：square-exponential envelope 下的任意阶 inverse-Hankel camouflage（2026-09-09）

本机证明 R112 的统一包络本身不能给 R186 所需的 inverse-Hankel 失败阶上界。
对任意 `N`，取 `2N+2` 个互不相交有限区间，利用 `(2N+1)x(2N+2)` 矩阵
`A_(k,j)=integral_(I_j)x^k gamma(x)dx` 的非平凡零空间，构造有界非零
`h_N` 正交于所有 `x^k`（`0<=k<=2N`）。令 `p_N=gamma(1+h_N)` 且
`||h_N||_infinity<=1/2`，则 `p_N` 是真正正密度，保持质量、均值、方差和
前 `2N` 阶 Gaussian 矩，同时统一满足
`E_(p_N)exp(X^2/8)<=sqrt(3)<2`。

对任意固定 `r>1`，逆 OU 候选
`K_(N,r)(u)=exp((r^2-1)u^2/2)phi_(N)(ru)` 的 `2N` 阶 Taylor jet 与
`exp(-u^2/2)` 完全相同，所以所有 `m<=N` 的 inverse-Hankel block 恰为
Gaussian 严格正定块。该结果是 `PROVED` 的 envelope-only obstruction，说明
统一尾界不能阻止检测阶逃逸；它不满足 `Q~chi^2_2` 或 same-factor product
identity，因而不是原始问题反例。R195 与 R186 不循环：前者否定“包络单独
给 uniform failure order”，后者保留 genuine primitive 子类上的 rank-closure
问题。`audit_r195.js` 已通过，整体发表性仍为“无”。

### R196：same-factor product identity 也没有 uniform finite-row detector（2026-09-09）

本机把 R195 的 moment camouflage 直接放回 genuine three-iid product law。对任意
`N`，取正的非 Gaussian 密度 `p_N`，保持单变量 Gaussian moments 到 `2N` 阶，
并满足统一 `E exp(X^2/8)<2`。令 `X_1,X_2,X_3` iid `p_N`、
`Q=sum_j(X_j-X_bar)^2`。因为 `Q^r` 是总次数 `2r` 的多项式，独立性给出：

`E_(p_N^3)Q^r=2^r r!`，`1<=r<=N`。

同样，`phi_N(u)=exp(-u^2/2)+O(u^(2N+1))`；在
`a_j(theta)=sqrt(2/3)cos(theta+2pi j/3)`、`sum_j a_j^2=1` 下，

`<prod_j phi_N(a_j(theta)u)>_theta=exp(-u^2/2)+O(u^(2N+1))`。

因此 same-factor product identity 的局部 Taylor 信息也不能给出与 `N` 无关的
finite-row detector。R196 是 `PROVED` 的 genuine positive finite-row
obstruction，但不是 full-exact counterexample；它说明若原始 rigidity 成立，
矛盾必须出现在 all-row limit、uniform asymptotic coercivity 或 compactness，而
不能来自固定有限 rows。`audit_r196.js` 已通过。

### R197：finite-row 非零 cubic 的 genuine IFT realization（2026-09-09）

本机把有限层 obstruction 进一步升级为直接保留非零 cubic。对每个固定
`M>=2`，以 `F_s=E Q^s-2^s s!`（`2<=s<=M`）为约束、以
`kappa_3=c` 为指定坐标，调节 `kappa_4,kappa_6,...,kappa_(2M)`。由于
`Q=(2/3)sum_i X_i^2-(2/3)sum_(i<j)X_iX_j`，`F_s` 不依赖高于 `2s`
的 cumulants，且

`partial F_s/partial kappa_(2s)=3(2/3)^s !=0`。

所以 Jacobian `D_(kappa_4,...,kappa_(2M))(F_2,...,F_M)` 是下三角可逆矩阵。
隐函数定理给出小的任意 `c!=0` 对应的偶 cumulant 补偿，使 `F_2=...=F_M=0`；
`F_1=0` 由中心化与方差一自动成立。用有界紧支撑平滑函数的局部指数族实现
这些 cumulant 坐标，并作 affine standardization，可保持正性、`C^infinity` 和
严格 log-concavity。

故对每个固定 finite `M`，存在 genuine positive same-factor iid law，满足
非零 `kappa_3` 且前 `M` 个 exact radial rows 全部精确成立。这是
`PROVED/ANALYTICALLY PROVED` 的 finite-row cubic-radius lemma，不是 all-row
counterexample；它直接说明原始 rigidity 若成立，必须是 moving-`M` 的全阶现象。
`audit_r197.js` 已通过，整体独立发表性仍为“无”。

### R198：finite-row cubic compensation 的精确二阶正规形（2026-09-09）

本机在 R197 的 IFT 接口上继续核验低阶正规形。中心化方差一并令
`c=kappa_3`，直接展开得到

`F_2:=E Q^2-8=(4/3)kappa_4`，

所以第二行精确强制 `kappa_4=0`。在 `kappa_4=kappa_5=0` 切片上，第三行
的真实 iid product expansion 为

`F_3:=E Q^3-48=(8/9)kappa_6+(8/3)c^2`。

故 `F_3=0` 当且仅当 `kappa_6=-3c^2`。将 `c=6epsilon` 代入 R191/R192 的
`A_3=5/18`、`B_3=1/12`，得到 `b_2=-3/20` 及
`kappa_6=6!b_2epsilon^2=-3c^2`，与 genuine finite-row 计算完全吻合。

这确认 R190–R192 的 formal compensation 在最初真实 rows 上没有代数漏洞，
也说明继续增加低阶 radial 展开不会自动产生 positivity obstruction；真正缺口
仍是补偿分支的 all-order positive-definiteness。证据等级为 `PROVED` 的有限
moment identity 加 `FORMAL CONSISTENCY`，不是 all-row counterexample；
`audit_r198.js` 已通过，整体独立发表性仍为“无”。

### R199：cubic compensation 分支的最低阶 Hankel 正定性 obstruction（2026-09-09）

本机继续检查 R198 分支
`kappa_3=c, kappa_4=kappa_5=0, kappa_6=-3c^2` 的 genuine moment 正性。
此时

`(m_0,...,m_6)=(1,0,1,c,3,10c,15+7c^2)`，

故四阶 moment block

`H_3=[[1,0,1,c],[0,1,c,3],[1,c,3,10c],[c,3,10c,15+7c^2]]`

必须半正定。精确计算给出

`det H_2=2-c^2`，
`det H_3=12-30c^2-6c^4=6(2-5c^2-c^4)`。

因此 genuine law 必须满足
`|c|<=c_*:=sqrt((sqrt(33)-5)/2)=0.610...`；在
`c_*<|c|<sqrt(2)` 时，前块 `H_2` 仍正定但 Schur defect
`6(2-5c^2-c^4)/(2-c^2)` 已为负。这是 `PROVED` 的 finite-row
PSD obstruction，但对 `c` 足够小行列式仍为正，不能排除小非零补偿分支，
所以仍不是 all-row rigidity。`audit_r199.js` 已通过，整体独立发表性仍为“无”。

### R200：第四 radial row 不收紧 R199 的 Hankel 阈值（2026-09-09）

本机继续沿 R198 补偿分支并加入 `F_4=E Q^4-384=0`。对
`kappa_3=c, kappa_4=kappa_5=0, kappa_6=-3c^2`，直接 product expansion
给出精确恒等式

`F_4=(16/27)kappa_8`。

故第四行只强制 `kappa_8=0`，而 `kappa_7` 不进入该行。令 `a=kappa_7`、
`u=c^2`，此时

`(m_0,...,m_8)=(1,0,1,c,3,10c,15+7u,a+105c,105+196u)`，

并有

`det H_4=(u-2)a^2-36c(4-3u)a+288-2160u-486u^2-630u^3`。

在 R199 阈值 `u_*=(sqrt(33)-5)/2` 内，取
`a=-18c(4-3u)/(2-u)`，则

`det H_4=((2-5u-u^2)(-630u^2+1008u+288))/(2-u)>0`。

同时 `H_3` 正定，所以该选择给出 `H_4` 正定的有限 moment 数据。于是
第四 exact row 与下一 Hankel block 没有进一步压缩小 `c` 区域；这是
`FINITE HANKEL FEASIBILITY/ESCAPE`，不是 representing-measure 或 all-row
结论。`audit_r200.js` 已通过，整体独立发表性仍为“无”。

### R201：第五 radial row 仍允许小 cubic 的 Hankel escape（2026-09-09）

本机在 R200 branch 上加入 `F_5=E Q^5-3840=0`。令
`kappa_3=c,kappa_4=kappa_5=0,kappa_6=-3c^2,kappa_7=a,kappa_8=0,
kappa_9=d,kappa_10=e`，则

`m_9=d+1260c+36a+28c^3`，
`m_10=e+945+4410c^2+120ca`，

且精确 product expansion 给出
`F_5=(32/81)(e+60ca)`。所以第五行只强制
`kappa_10=-60c kappa_7`，不约束 `kappa_9`。

进一步取 `a=e=0`、`u=c^2`，写
`D_3=12-30u-6u^2`，
`B=-5760c+21600c^3-4968c^5-252c^7`，
`C=34560-604800u+705888u^2-2685096u^3-259497u^4+2646u^5`。
直接计算得到

`det H_5=-D_3 d^2+B d+C`。

取 `d=B/(2D_3)`。对 `0<|c|<=1/10`，可严格验证 `H_3,H_4` 正定且
`C>0`，于是 `H_5` 也正定。故前五个 radial rows 与固定 Hankel block
仍不能排除小非零 cubic；这是 `PROVED` 的 finite-row/Hankel escape，
不是 representing measure、all-row law 或原始 counterexample。
`audit_r201.js` 已通过，整体独立发表性仍为“无”。

### R202：第六 radial row 的局部 Hankel escape（2026-09-09）

本机固定 R201 的选择 `kappa_7=kappa_8=kappa_10=0`，令
`kappa_9=d,kappa_11=f,kappa_12=g`。累积量--矩递推给出

`m_11=f+17325c+1540c^3+55d`，
`m_12=g+10395+97020c^2-8162c^4+220cd`。

直接展开第六 product row 得到

`F_6=(64/243)(g+120cd-3213c^4)`，

故 `F_6=0` 只确定 `kappa_12=3213c^4-120c kappa_9`，而 `kappa_11`
不进入该 row。沿 R201 的 `d(c)=B(c)/(2D_3(c))`、取 `f(c)=0`，
补偿后的 `H_6(c)` 在 `c=0` 是 Gaussian 七阶 moment Hankel 正定块，
且矩阵元素连续；由正定锥开性，存在 `epsilon>0` 使 `H_6(c)\succ0`
对 `|c|<epsilon` 成立。`audit_r202.js` 已通过。

这是 `PROVED` 的第六行补偿公式与 `FINITE-ROW LOCAL FEASIBILITY`，不是
all-row positive law 或原始 counterexample；整体独立发表性仍为“无”。

### R203：finite-row escape principle 的统一抽象（2026-09-09）

本机把 R197–R202 的逐行现象抽象为一个一般命题。对
`F_s=E Q^s-2^s s!`，`Q` 的总次数为 `2s`，最高单变量 moment 只来自三个
纯项，故

`partial F_s/partial kappa_(2s)=3(2/3)^s !=0`，

且 `F_s` 不依赖 `kappa_(2r)`（`r>s`）。因此固定 `M` 时，偶 cumulant 对
`F_2,...,F_M` 的 Jacobian 下三角且可逆；把奇 cumulants 当参数，隐函数定理
给出唯一局部 finite-row compensation。结合 R197 的 genuine realization，
得到任意固定有限行都不能单独推出 `kappa_3=0`。

在 R124/R125 的紧性接口成立时，真正需要证明的是 genuine finite-row cubic
radius `Gamma_M->0`，而不是继续寻找固定阶 determinant。same-factor angular
identity 是尚未进入该 radial IFT 链的首个结构入口；R186 rank closure、R188
`(MT_r)` 和最终 tower rigidity 仍未闭合。`audit_r203.js` 已通过，整体独立
发表性仍为“无”。
### R204：全局脉络、证据分层与发表性审计（2026-09-09）

本轮没有把新的有限层计算包装成主命题突破，而是对截至 R203 的完整路线作总审计。
原始 Positive Backward-Tower Exact Zero-Set Rigidity 仍为 `OPEN`；当前独立、完整、
可审稿的发表性总评仍是“无”。已经闭合或本机审计的部分包括 R99–R102 的变换接口、
R132 的 genuine all-row smoothing 模块，以及 R197–R203 的 finite-row exact
compensation、genuine positive local realization 和前六行 Hankel escape。R150、
R166、R173–R188 属于带明确假设的条件性链；R190–R196 属于 formal/finite-only
检测阶逃逸。

审计特别固定了四个不能偷换的缺口：`RK=1=>full-exact`、原始 `P_3K` 与空间/
Bargmann/MGF/angular charges 的 provenance bridge、primitive inverse-Hankel rank
closure、以及 mixed total-degree `(MT_r)` 到最终 backward-tower rigidity 的组合桥。
R197–R203 最接近一个可独立表述的负面小定理：固定有限 radial rows 不能单独消灭
小非零 cubic，但它不是 all-row counterexample，因此整体发表性结论不变。完整审计
与全局图见 `r204_global_publication_audit/README.md`。

下一条唯一主任务：停止继续增加 radial 行数，直接利用 genuine same-factor
characteristic identity 检查 R188 的 `(MT_r)`；若无法推出，则构造精确标注为 formal
的 mixed-sector total-degree escape lemma。
### R205：径向 same-factor 恒等式的均值频率盲区（2026-09-09）

本机把 R188 的 mixed-sector 缺口写成精确坐标引理。对
`U=(X_1+X_2+X_3)/sqrt(3)`、`T=|R|^2/2`，带公共频率的 product transform 满足

`A(s,y)=E[exp(i s U)J_0(y sqrt(2T))]`。

已知径向 same-factor identity 只有 `A(0,y)=exp(-y^2/2)`；Bessel/Laplace 单射
说明它等价于 `T~Exp(1)`。所有 `U|T` mixed coefficients 则来自
`partial_s^ell A(0,y)`，再经 Laguerre 投影得到 `C_(ell,n)`。因此该 identity
单独不能推出 R188 的 `(MT_r)`。R188 的 abstract mixed-sector migration 在此
信息层面保持相同 `T` 边缘并推迟非零 `C_(ell,N)`，但不是 genuine same-factor
反例。`r205_mean_frequency_blindness/audit_r205.js` 已通过。

R205 的证据等级为 `PROVED` 坐标/Bessel 投影加 `ABSTRACT OBSTRUCTION`，与
R190 的线性化 blind ladder、R186 的正性检测阶逃逸分属不同层。下一条唯一任务
是从 same-factor positivity 或四点 bispectrum Gram 得到真正的 `s`-dependent
bound；否则正式记录该 OPEN bridge，不再增加 radial rows。
### R206：从 R205 回接 R145–R149 的真正缺口（2026-09-09）

本轮发现并修正了一个全局表述风险：R205 说“缺少 `s`-dependent 信息”容易与
R145–R149 已有的 shifted Bessel–Schur、tilted Laguerre、Appell regression、
continuum boundary 和 reflection compensation 冲突。准确说法是：径向 exact
identity 只有 `s=0` 切片，但 R145–R149 已给出若干 `s`-dependent 不等式；它们
目前都没有产生 `partial_s A(0,t)=0` 或 `E[C|Q]=0` 所需的反向符号。

因此当前最强正向路线是 R145–R149 的 continuum common–residual regression
package，最强负向补充是 R197–R203 的 finite-row blindness package。原始主命题
仍 OPEN，整体完整发表性仍为“无”。下一条唯一任务是联立 R145/R146/R147/R149
现有公式，检查能否推出 `ell_1(a)ell_1(-a)>=0` 或 `K''=1`；若不能，给出
不属于 genuine iid full-SF 类的最小 wrong-sign/relaxed witness。完整纠偏记录在
`r206_global_reanchor/README.md`。
### R207：反射首 Laguerre 符号的 Gaussian rigidity 判据（2026-09-09）

本机将 R206 的符号接口写成精确判据。analytic full-SF + odd-first-cumulant 下，
`ell_1(a)=1-K''(a/sqrt(3))`，若首个非 Gaussian cumulant 阶 `d` 为奇数，则

`ell_1(a)=-kappa_d a^(d-2)/(3^((d-2)/2)(d-2)!)+O(a^(d-1))`，

从而 `ell_1(a)ell_1(-a)<0`。因此证明局部
`ell_1(a)ell_1(-a)>=0`、或单边 `K''<=1`/`K''>=1`，本身就足以推出 Gaussian。
但现有反射交叉谱只有
`J(a)=-a^2 E[E(C|Q)^2]+O(a^4)`，普通 Cauchy 下界二阶项也为负，故已有正性
工具不能给出所需反射正性。`audit_r207.js` 已通过；该结果属于条件性 rigidity
certificate，不是 bare `RK=1` 或 genuine full-SF characterization。整体发表性仍为
“无”。下一条唯一任务是检查 genuine iid full-SF factorization 是否能产生该局部
reflection sign；否则记录更强但仍允许 wrong sign 的正性上界。
### R208：有限 Bochner/Gram 条件的反射奇偶 no-go（2026-09-09）

本机证明任意有限 Bochner Gram 在 law reflection 下仅变为 entrywise conjugate，
所以 principal minors、特征值和 PSD 完全不变。Gaussian 附近的 odd-cumulant
扰动 `epsilon` 因而只能通过 `epsilon^2` 等偶次进入有限实值 Gram 证书；这与
R108 的 `m_3^2` wall 一致，却不能给 R207 所需的 tilted `a->-a` reflection sign。

结合 R193 的有限 Gram 正谱隙和 R196/R197 的 finite-row escape，当前准确边界是：
固定有限 Gram 可以给 reflection-even 的大小约束，但不能单独闭合
`ell_1(a)ell_1(-a)>=0`；任何负证书都必须走频率/阶数/配置退化或负裕量逃逸。
`audit_r208.js` 已通过，整体 rigidity 与发表性仍为 OPEN/“无”。下一条唯一任务
是审查无限频率/连续 tilt 的 Gram 或 bispectrum 是否能产生真正反射符号，不能则
记录 all-scale sign 的 compactness 缺口。

### R209：连续 tilt Gram 仍不能产生反射符号（2026-09-09）

本轮把 R208 的固定有限 Gram 推广到整个连续 tilt 轴，得到一个严格的
`RELAXED OBSTRUCTION`。令 `Q~Exp(1)`，令 `C(Q)=+1` 与 `-1` 分别落在两个
等概率分区，并定义

`r_a(Q)=E[e^(aC)|Q]/E[e^(aC)]=1+C(Q)tanh(a)`。

则 `r_a` 在所有实 `a` 上严格正、解析、归一化，且其全尺度 covariance kernel

`K(a,b)=E[(r_a-1)(r_b-1)]=tanh(a)tanh(b)`

在整个 `R×R` 上 PSD（任意有限抽样均为 rank-one Gram）。可是

`K(a,-a)=-tanh²(a)<0`，并且逐点饱和 conditional-Cauchy 下界：
`r_a r_{-a}=1/(M_C(a)M_C(-a))`。

因此即使给出 `Q~Exp(1)`、全尺度正 tilt、连续 PSD kernel 和最强的现有
conditional-Cauchy，也不能推出 R207 需要的 `J(a)>=0` 或
`ell_1(a)ell_1(-a)>=0`。这不是 genuine iid same-factor 反例：该 `(C,Q)`
没有来自三个 iid scalar variables 的正交坐标与 one-body factorization。
它严格说明后续必须寻找超出一般 PSD covariance 的 same-factor nonlinear
identity；把有限 Gram 加密为连续 Gram 仍不够。`audit_r209.js` 已通过。

全局审计不变：原始 Positive Backward-Tower Exact Zero-Set Rigidity 仍为
`OPEN`；目前独立、完整、可审稿的发表性判断仍为“无”。最接近的组合仍是
R197--R203 的 finite-row non-annihilation theorem 与 R145--R149/R207/R209
的 continuum reflection-sign 边界包，后者是 conditional/relaxed obstruction，
不能冒充原始 rigidity。下一轮唯一任务是直接研究 genuine same-factor
factorization 是否产生超出一般 PSD 的反射符号；若不能，正式固定该 bridge
为 OPEN，并回到 `RK=1=>full-SF`、charge provenance、primitive closure、
mixed-tail 与 tower rigidity 的独立缺口。

### R210：残差边缘律与 mixed covariance 刻画的严格分界（2026-09-09）

本轮结合经典正态刻画文献，重新核对当前正向接口。对
`C=(X_1+X_2+X_3)/sqrt(3)`、`Q=sum_j(X_j-Xbar)^2`，令 `x=s/sqrt(3)`、
`phi(x)=E exp(i x X)`、`k=log phi`，直接展开得到

`E[(Q-2) exp(i s C)] = -2 phi(x)^3(1+k''(x))`。

因此在 zero-free neighborhood、neighborhood-MGF 与矩决定性下，
`Cov(Q,exp(i s C))=0` 对所有 `s` 立即推出 `K''=1` 与 Gaussian。这是
R145/R146/R207 的 constant-regression / first-Laguerre closure，并由
Rademacher 直接枚举审计通过。

但 genuine full-SF/all-row 目前只给 `Q~chi^2_2`，等价于 `s=0` 的 residual
Laplace boundary；它没有给 `Cov(Q,exp(i s C))=0`、`E[Q|C]=2` 或
`E[C|Q]=0`。经典文献中的 sample-mean/sample-variance independence
characterization 因而只能作为接口定位，不能被当作本项目主命题的证明。

R210 的证据等级为 `PROVED/LOCAL-AUDITED` 的 mixed formula 与 conditional
Gaussian closure，`OPEN` 的 full-SF-to-mixed-covariance bridge。整体独立、完整、
可审稿发表性仍为“无”。`audit_r210.js` 已通过。下一轮唯一任务：只研究
genuine same-factor product identity 是否能推出 mixed covariance zero 的任一
非平凡片段；若不能，记录最小 same-factor obstruction，保持
`RK=>full-SF`、charge provenance、primitive closure、`MT_r`、tower rigidity
五个缺口分离。

### R211：Esscher tilt 稳定性的聚点放大引理（2026-09-09）

本轮把正向目标量词化。对 `C=(X_1+X_2+X_3)/sqrt(3)`、
`Q=sum_j(X_j-Xbar)^2`，共同 Esscher tilt 下精确有

`E_a Q=2 K''(a/sqrt(3))`, `ell_1(a)=1-K''(a/sqrt(3))`。

因此若某个 MGF 区间内的参数集合 `A` 有内部聚点，且仅有
`ell_1(a)=0` 对所有 `a∈A`，解析恒等定理即给出 `K''=1` 与 Gaussian；
若一组有聚点的 tilt 保持完整 `Q~chi^2_2`，更当然成立。这个结论只需
首个 Laguerre mode，不需全部 tilted rows。

R211 明确了原始缺口：未倾斜 full-SF 只有 `a=0` 的 marginal boundary，
OU backward 参数也不自动产生 Esscher tilt stability。因此该结果是
`PROVED/LOCAL-AUDITED` 的 conditional closure，不是原始 rigidity。整体
发表性仍为“无”；`audit_r211.js` 已通过。下一轮唯一任务是研究 genuine
same-factor product identity 是否能产生任何非平凡 tilted zero 序列，或把
它与 mixed covariance zero 连接起来；五个既有缺口继续分离。

### R212：经典 sample-variance χ² 边界与全项目发表性定位（2026-09-09）

本轮没有把文献中的 restricted converse 偷换成项目定理。对三 iid 标量变量
`C=(X_1+X_2+X_3)/sqrt(3)`、`Q=sum_i(X_i-Xbar)^2`，`Q~chi^2_2` 的反向
Gaussian 刻画正是经典 `chi^2` conjecture 的 `n=3` 核心；公开综述仍将无
对称性等额外限制的 classical problem 标为 open。Ruben 的 `n=2`/对称性、
两个样本量结果，以及 Golikova--Kruglov 的 infinitely divisible 结果，均需要
项目没有自动给出的额外输入；均值—方差独立也比 residual marginal law 强得多。

这与 R210/R211 的结构严格一致：full-SF 只给 `s=0` 的 residual 边缘律，
R210 的 mixed covariance zero 与 R211 的 accumulating Esscher zeros 是条件性
闭合模块，不能反向当作已知。因而整体独立、完整、可审稿发表性仍为“无”。
R203、R210、R211 加 R212 文献边界可以组成一个有潜在发表价值的研究包，但在
缺少 genuinely new bridge 前，不能称为已完成论文结果。

下一最小任务固定为：检查 positivity 加 backward-OU divisibility 是否能推出
对称性、标量 infinite divisibility、第二个样本量的 exact identity，或任一
非平凡 mixed identity；若均不能，把 `full-SF-to-Gaussian` 明确封存为经典
open-core，并停止继续堆叠 radial rows。记录与核验脚本见
`r212_classical_chisquare_boundary/README.md`、`audit_r212.js`。

### R213：正性与有限 OU backward divisibility 的分离构造（2026-09-09）

本轮构造 `u(x)=x exp(-x^2)-c x exp(-2x^2)`、`c=(5/3)^(3/2)`。精确 Gaussian
积分给出 `E[u]=E[Xu]=E[X^2u]=0`，但 `E[X^3u]=2/(15 sqrt(3))`。故小非零
`epsilon` 下 `1+epsilon u` 是正的、中心化、方差一且非对称的 density。
对任意有限深度 `N` 取 `g^(j)=P_(q^(N-j))f_epsilon`，得到每层正的 exact
OU backward chain，并保留 `kappa_3(g^(j))=q^(3(N-j))kappa_3(f_epsilon)!=0`。

因此 positivity+finite OU divisibility+standardization 不能推出 symmetry；由
R210 的 mixed formula，`Cov(Q,exp(isC))=(2i/sqrt(3))kappa_3 s+O(s^2)`，也不能
推出 mixed zero。该构造不满足 `RK=1/full-SF`，不是原始反例；它是
`PROVED/LOCAL-AUDITED` 的 finite-depth separation，以及固定 bounded tangent
下的 `FINITE-ONLY/OBSTRUCTION`。moving-degree escape、scalar infinite
divisibility、第二样本量 identity 和 full-SF+tower rigidity 仍 OPEN。审计见
`r213_finite_backward_separation/audit_r213.js`。

### R214：固定底层与 varying-bottom tower 的二分（2026-09-09）

本轮把 R101 与 R166 联立成一个全局 structural reduction。若固定 genuine
full-exact law `mu` 对每个 `N` 都有正 exact preimage at scale `q^N`，R101 的
`tau_ang(mu)>0` 与 `q^N->0` 矛盾，故固定底层必须 angular-symmetric。另一方面，
R166 已给出 `A_3^MGF <=> B_q^MGF`：存在一个 asymmetric genuine exact 单律
等价于存在底层趋于 Gaussian 且 MGF cubic charge 每层非零的 varying-bottom
tower。其 `tau_ang(P_s h)=s tau_ang(h)` 说明 varying-bottom 的 threshold
趋零是结构必然。

故塔深度本身不是额外独立障碍；真正核心是 asymmetric genuine exact single-law
exclusion/构造，并且还要分开 scalar `RK=1` 桥和 spatial `P_3K` provenance。
R214 是 `PROVED UNDER STATED HYPOTHESES / LOCAL-AUDITED` 的固定底层排除与
单律等价，`CONDITIONAL` 的对象转移，整体独立完整发表性仍为“无”。记录见
`r214_fixed_vs_moving_tower_dichotomy/README.md`。

### R215：genuine full-exact varying-bottom 塔的两尺度逃逸二分（2026-09-09）

本轮把 R173、R176–R178、R186 与 R214 合并。对 genuine full-exact
`g_N^(0)=P_(q^N)g_N^(N)`，若底层首 odd 阶为 `d_N`，R173 给出
`0<|beta_(d_N,1)(g_N^(0))|^2 <= (q^N)^(d_N)`。子列后二分为：`d_N` 有界，
首 charge 固定阶指数塌缩；或 `d_N->infinity`，R178 给出
`a_(d_N)(g_N^(0))^2 <= O(d_N^(3/4)(sqrt(3)q^N)^(d_N))`。同时 R186 的
primitive failure order 在 Gaussian 极限下趋于无穷。故当前最小缺口被准确写成
charge degree/amplitude escape 与 primitive-rank escape 的兼容性，而不是继续
增加 radial rows。

R215 是 genuine full-exact/full-SF 下的 `PROVED/LOCAL-AUDITED` 预算综合，
双逃逸的统一闭合仍 `SYNTHESIS/CONDITIONAL/OPEN`；它不构成原始反例或主定理，
整体独立完整发表性仍为“无”。记录与审计见
`r215_two_scale_escape_dichotomy/README.md`、`audit_r215.js`。

### R216：Angular-to-Hankel cross-witness 的对象错位审计（2026-09-09）

本轮审查网页端提出的 cross-witness 接口，没有把 R101 angular cone 与 R186
ordinary inverse-Hankel witness 偷换成同一对象。R101 需要 genuine positive
full-exact、三份 iid 同因子前像；R186 的 Hamburger 实现只保证 ordinary
moment positivity，不恢复 same-factor exact identity、bare `RK=1` 或 spatial
`P_3K` provenance。

本机用 Vandermonde null vector 构造 `u_L=sum c_k x exp(-k x^2)`：`1+epsilon*u_L`
相对 Gaussian 在 `2L` 阶以内矩匹配，但首 odd 阶 `D=2L+1` 非零。调节
`t=(|beta_(D,1)|^2/2)^(1/D)` 后，有限 angular budget 为 `2`，而 formal
inverse-Hankel 的 `H_L^(r)` 仍等于严格正的 Gaussian Hankel。L=2、4 的
`audit_r216.js` 通过。

这是一条 `FINITE-ONLY / OBSTRUCTION`：它排除不依赖 angular degree 的低阶
ordinary-Hankel 转换，却不是 genuine full-exact 反例，也不否定某个真正使用
same-factor 结构的 `M(D,r)` 仍可能存在。cross-witness、asymmetric exact 单律
排除与最终 rigidity 继续 `OPEN`；独立完整可审稿发表性仍为“无”。

### R217：Gaussian-flat odd jet 的一行 cross-witness benchmark（2026-09-09）

在 R216 上继续推导：对任意 `L>=1`、`D=2L+1` 的 Gaussian-flat odd jet，令
`rho=t^(-D)|beta_(D,1)|^2`。前 `2L` 阶的 formal inverse-Hankel 仍等于严格
正的 Gaussian Hankel；第一个差异只出现在 `m_D`，在 Hermite 基底中使
`H_(L+1)` 的 `(L,L+1)` 主块出现 off-diagonal
`delta_D/sqrt(L!(L+1)!)`。

精确阈值为 `rho_H=Lambda_D^2 L!(L+1)!/D!`，并有 `rho_H<1`；所以该 relaxed
类中任何 angular budget `rho>1` 都会在下一 Hankel 行被检测。L=2、4、rho=2
的本机审计通过。

这是 `PROVED / LOCAL-AUDITED` 的 relaxed finite-jet benchmark，不是 genuine
full-exact/RK=1 反例。它把下一步压缩为：能否用 genuine same-factor 结构证明
类似的 `O(D)` 阶负证书；否则必须构造 genuine-compatible 的高阶逃逸。原始
rigidity 与独立完整可审稿发表性仍分别为 OPEN 与“无”。

### R218：首个 odd packet 的 genuine degree-matched cross-witness（2026-09-09）

本轮将 R133 的 full-SF 首 odd packet 与 R217 的一行 Hankel 计算联立。若
`D=2s+1` 是 genuine analytic full-exact law 的首个非零 odd 阶，则 R133 强制
`kappa_4,...,kappa_(2D-2)=0`，所以 inverse-OU formal moments 到 `D+1` 阶
只有第 `D` 阶 odd moment偏离 Gaussian。于是 `H_(s+1)` 在 normalized Hermite
基底的唯一新项位于 `(s,s+1)`，行列式为 `1-rho/rho_H`，其中
`rho=t^(-D)|beta_(D,1)|^2`、`rho_H=Lambda_D^2*s!(s+1)!/D!<1`。

故在 genuine full-SF 首 odd 子类中严格有
`t^(-D)|beta_(D,1)|^2>1 => H_((D+1)/2) not PSD`。`audit_r218.js` 对
`D=3,5,9,17` 通过。这不是 relaxed 反例，而是 genuine degree-matched
cross-witness 的首个实质子定理；多 odd degree 合计预算、负特征值 uniform
裕量及原始 `RK=1` 桥仍 OPEN，整体完整可审稿发表性仍为“无”。

### MGF-QS-01：rank-one transform stability 与 TV 的 phase-change obstruction（2026-09-10）

网页端在当前 MGF quadratic-form 方向完成了一轮实质稳定性分析。对
`Q=X^2`、`EX=0`、`EX^2=1` 及局部 dominance
`M_X(t)M_X(-t)>=exp(t^2)`，若输入不是普通 TV/弱距离，而是局部径向
Laplace 距离
`sup_{|t|<=tau}|exp(-t^2/2) E cosh(t sqrt(Q))-1|<=epsilon`，
则代数上严格得到
`d_MGF<=epsilon+sqrt(2epsilon+epsilon^2)=O(sqrt(epsilon))`，并同时
控制 `E exp(H)-1`、Jensen gap 与对称化 MGF defect。该部分是
`PROVED/ALGEBRAICALLY-AUDITED` 的 transform-stability，而非经典距离稳定性。

网页端进一步给出稀有 Poisson 跳跃修复反例：先用 `Y=S|G|` 让 `Y^2=G^2`
但 `Y` 非 Gaussian，再取 `lambda_n=K/n^4`、跳幅 `n` 并标准化。四阶
正的 `cosh` 余项可在固定 MGF 邻域内补偿 `Y` 的负 dominance defect，因而
每个 `X_n` 满足局部 dominance；但 `X_n->Y` in TV，故
`d_TV(L(X_n^2),chi^2_1)->0` 而 `X_n` 不趋于 Gaussian，且 `E exp(H)` 可发散。
这是 `PROVED UNDER EXPLICIT CONSTRUCTION / LOCAL-NUMERIC-AUDIT` 的
`OBSTRUCTION`：说明 approximate radial law 必须配 uniform exponential
integrability 或 transform tightness，不能把 exact rigidity 直接连续化。

在统一包络 `E exp(2tau|X|)<=K_0` 下，TV 与 `chi^2_1` 的接近可先通过
TV--Cauchy--Schwarz 转为径向 Laplace 接近，再接上面的 `O(sqrt(epsilon))`
MGF 控制。这只闭合到局部变换稳定性；从点态 symmetrized MGF 到 TV/Wasserstein
仍是 quantitative Cramer 问题。一般 PSD 情形目前只得到 integrated spherical
defect bound，sample-variance 情形的剩余关卡是球面加权 L1 defect 到点态
`D(s)` 的定量反演。完整记录见 `r219_mgf_stability_audit/README.md`。

本轮本机 Node 积分复核 `c=0.6487212707001282`、`EY≈0`、`EY^2≈1`，
`tau=0.5` 时 `C_tau≈0.00390474`；对 `n=10,30,100` 的 Poisson 修复网格
缺陷均非负（零点仅在 `t=0`）。没有发现当前代数构造的数值矛盾，但其解析
反例、sample-variance 点态反演、直接先例排查和整体发表性仍保持 `OPEN/未认证`。

### MGF-QS-02：sample-variance 球面 L1 到内部点态界（2026-09-10）

网页端本轮给出并本机逐式核对了一个明确的剩余引理。设 `q=sqrt((n-1)/n)`、
`a=tau*q`、`tau'<a`、`eta=log(1+epsilon)/n`。对
`V_1~Unif(S^{n-2})`，密度为
`c_n(1-v^2)^((n-4)/2)`，其中
`c_n=Gamma((n-1)/2)/(sqrt(pi)Gamma((n-2)/2))`；`n=3` 是 arcsine 密度。
统一指数包络 `E exp(2*tau|X|)<=K` 给出
`Lip(D;[-b,b])<=L_h=sqrt(K)+b`。取 `b=tau'+h`、`0<h<a-tau'`，
`m_h=(c_n/a)(1-(b/a)^2)^(max(n-4,0)/2)`，则

`sup_{|s|<=tau'}D(s)<=G(eta/(2*m_h);L_h,h)`，

其中 `G(y;L,h)=sqrt(L*y)`（`y<=Lh^2`），否则为
`y/(2h)+Lh/2`。进一步对 `h` 取下确界，或取 `h=(a-tau')/2`，得到显式
`O(sqrt(log(1+epsilon)/n))` 内部稳定性。tent 证明使用 `D` 的偶性得到
两个不相交 tents，因而保留因子 `2`。注意网页端原式把 `y` 写成
`2*m_h*eta`；由 `eta>=2*m_h*I` 正确应为 `y=eta/(2*m_h)`，已在项目记录中
纠正；没有发现额外的 `q` 或 `n` 错乘。

该关卡现在标为 `PROVED UNDER STATED HYPOTHESES / LOCAL-PROOF-AUDIT`。
它把 sample-variance approximate radial law 推到 coordinate-level local MGF
stability，但仍不等于 classical distribution-distance stability；下一轮转向
`X-X'` 的 local symmetrized-MGF 控制如何给出可证明的 quantitative Cramer
结论，并继续保持 novelty 未认证。

### MGF-QS-03：解析延拓审计与 Kolmogorov 阶段（2026-09-10）

网页端按审计要求修正了 quantitative Cramer 回合的关键公式。若
`D=1/2 log(M(s)M(-s)/exp(s^2))<=delta`，则 `Y=X-X'` 的 defect 应记为
`Delta=2*delta`。在 `0<rho<2*tau` 下，令
`A=exp(rho^2)(exp(Delta)-1)`、`B=K^2+exp(rho^2)`、`L=log(B/A)`，并取
`T=(2*rho/pi)log(L/log L)`、`H=B/L`、
`C4=K/(8*tau^4)+3/4`、`r=min(T/2,(H/C4)^(1/4))`。正确的条带参数为
`alpha=pi/(2*rho)`，次调和函数为 `log(|F|/B)`，故 Esseen 给出

`d_K(L(Y),N(0,2)) <= C4*r^4/(2*pi)+(2H/pi)log(T/r)+12/(pi^(3/2)T)`。

该 Y 阶段已通过本机逐式审计，且为 `O(1/log log(1/Delta))`。再引用允许
两个 summand 不同的 Sapogov 定量 Cramer 定理，可得
`d_K(L(X),N(0,1))<=C_S/sqrt(log(1/eta_Delta))`；但 `C_S` 尚未追踪，
因此只能标为 `PROVED AFTER NAMED THEOREM`，不可写成完全数值显式。
标准化 Poisson 给出固定 EI 下的 `D_lambda=O(lambda^(-1))`、odd part
`O(lambda^(-1/2))` 与 `d_TV=1`，只否定 TV，不否定 Kolmogorov。

当前下一任务是：直接利用反射结构 `phi_{X-X'}=|phi_X|^2`，尝试把一般
Sapogov 的三重对数损失降到单对数或多项式；若做不到，就追踪 Sapogov
常数并把现有结果整理为可审稿的弱距离稳定性定理。

### MGF-QS-04：反射结构的 Poisson 速率障碍（2026-09-10）

网页端核验标准化 Poisson `X_m=(N_m-m)/sqrt(m)`：其 reflected defect
`Delta_m=sup_{|s|<=rho}(log M_{X_m-X_m'}(s)-s^2)` 满足
`rho^4/(12m)<=Delta_m<=rho^4*cosh(rho)/(12m)`，而位于零点的原子给出
`d_K(X_m,N)>=e^(-1/12)/(2sqrt(2*pi*m))`。故固定 EI 类中的统一模量不能
是 `o(sqrt(Delta))`，幂率指数至多 `1/2`；但这并不排除 `Delta^alpha`
（`alpha<1/2`）或更慢率。该族不否定 Kolmogorov，只否定 TV 模量。

网页端还明确区分了 iid self-convolution `F*F` 与本题 reflected convolution
`F*F^<-`：前者的 polynomial Cramer 文献不能直接使用，后者的 characteristic
function 只有 `|phi_X|^2`。当前下一最小任务是审查高频 odd-density 扰动加微小
对称补偿，是否能构造固定 EI、局部 dominance 下的非幂率 sharpness family。

### MGF-QS-05：高频 odd 扰动形成非幂率 sharpness 障碍（2026-09-10）

网页端本轮给出的候选通过了本机逐项审计。取
`h_n(x)=sin(n*x)-c_n*sin(x)`、`c_n=n*exp(-(n^2-1)/2)`，
`f_n=phi*(1+epsilon*h_n)`，再加独立 Skellam 补偿
`W_n=(X_n+J_n)/sqrt(1+lambda_n)`，其中
`lambda_n=(2*epsilon^2/3)*exp(-n^2)*(n^3+n)^2*rho^2`。
高斯积分直接给出 `EX_n=0`、`EX_n^2=1` 和
`M_X=exp(s^2/2)(1+u_n)`，`u_n=epsilon*exp(-n^2/2)
*(sin(ns)-n*sin(s))`；Skellam 的正四阶余项逐点补偿
`log(1-u_n^2)` 的负项，确实得到 `R_n(s)>=0`。

更精确地，在 `|s|<=rho` 上
`R_n(s)>=(epsilon^2/18)*exp(-n^2)*(n^3+n)^2*v^4*(rho^2-v^2)`，
`v=s/sqrt(1+lambda_n)`；上界为
`R_n(s)<= (epsilon^2/18)*exp(-n^2)*(n^3+n)^2*rho^6*cosh(rho)`。
在 `s=rho/2` 处对充分大 `n` 有相应正下界，故
`Delta_n=Theta_{rho,epsilon}(n^6*exp(-n^2))`。统一指数包络来自
`f_n<=C_epsilon*phi`、`sup_n lambda_n<infinity` 与 Skellam MGF。

在零点，`I(n)=int_0^infinity phi(x)sin(nx)dx=phi(0)/n+O(n^-2)`，
故 `|F_X(0)-1/2|>=c(epsilon)/n`；Skellam 事件 `J_n!=0` 的影响至多
`lambda_n=o(1/n)`，从而 `d_K(W_n,N)>=c(epsilon)/n`。因此
`d_K>=c/sqrt(log(1/Delta_n))`，排除了任意统一正幂率和更快的
`o(1/sqrt(log(1/Delta)))` 模量。该结果是 `PROVED / LOCAL-PROOF-AUDIT`，
但没有给出匹配的单对数平方根上界；三重对数上界是否可改善仍 `OPEN`，
论文暂不启动。

## 2026-09-10 第六稳定性回合：消失矩 Laguerre 奇扰动候选

为避免在“高频正弦族”上局部优化，本机提出了一个更强的候选反例：
`p_m(x)=x exp(-x^2)L_m^(1/2)(3x^2/2)`。若标准 Laguerre 界给出固定
`C_L>=sup|p_m|`，取 `h_m=p_m/C_L` 并令 `f_m=phi(1+epsilon h_m)`。Laguerre 正交性直接给出
前 `m` 个奇矩为零，因此 `u_m(s)=M_{f_m}(s)/exp(s^2/2)-1` 在 `s=0`
处从 `2m+1` 阶开始；生成函数给出精确式
`u_m(s)=(epsilon/C_L)[s/(3sqrt(3))]exp(-s^2/3)(-s^2/6)^m/m!`，
故 `|u_m(s)|<=a_m|s|^(2m+1)`，其中
`a_m=epsilon/[3sqrt(3)C_L 6^m m!]`。

该族的半轴偏差有精确表达式：
`int_0^infinity h_m phi=[1/(3sqrt(2pi)C_L)](1/2)_m/m!`，故若标准界
`C_L<infinity` 成立，则偏差为 `Theta(m^(-1/2))`。配合参数
`lambda_m=96 a_m^2 rho^(4m-2)` 的独立 Skellam 对称补偿，预期得到
`Delta_m=Theta(lambda_m)`、`log(1/Delta_m)=2m log m+O(m)`，而
`d_K(W_m,N)>=c/sqrt(m)`。这会产生
`d_K >= c sqrt(log log(1/Delta)/log(1/Delta))`，严格否定当前正在追踪的
`C/sqrt(log(1/Delta))` 上界。

这轮只记录为 `CANDIDATE / LOCAL-DERIVATION`。待网页端核验的四个具体点是：
(i) `exp(-z/2)|L_m^(1/2)(z)|` 的一致界；(ii) Taylor 余项常数；(iii) Skellam
dominance 的逐点双侧估计；(iv) 补偿对 CDF 下界的影响。若这四点闭合，
应把稳定性主命题的“最后缺口”改写为修正后的对数模量，而不是继续重复单对数上界。
